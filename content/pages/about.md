I'm a Bay Area-based data scientist with varied experience in experimentation, visualization, machine learning, and network analysis. I'm most at home when I'm getting my hands dirty with <b>Python</b> (particularly the <b>numpy</b> / <b>sklearn</b> / <b>pandas</b> scientific stack) and <b>SQL</b> of all flavors. I write a bit of <b>R</b> when I have to. More recently, I've enjoyed working with <b>React.js</b> and <b>d3.js</b> to build data visualizations and small web projects, including this site. On the side I enjoy writing. This site is a space for me to display projects that combine one of more of these interests. I'll update it periodically as I build things that I think are worth sharing.

**I'm currently actively seeking opportunities in Data Science or related fields.** If you're interested in connecting, you can send me an email at **macrane22**\[**AT**\]**gmail**\[**DOT**\]**com**, or add me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthcrane/).
