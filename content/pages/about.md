I'm a Bay Area-based data scientist with  experience in experimentation, modeling, and network analysis, particularly to community detection. I'm most at home working with **Python** (particularly the scientific stack) and **SQL**. More recently, I've begun working with React and D3 to build data visualizations. I also enjoy writing and data visualization, which is much of what appears on this site.

I am currently in the market for a data science position.
