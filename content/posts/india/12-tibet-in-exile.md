Gozde had a way of making everything sound important, even if she was just announcing a trip to the bathroom. She would lay a hand on my arm, look at me with big eyes, and begin, "Met, I am thinking..." before going off in her roundabout but elegant broken English. This may have had something to do with why I changed my route: I had skipped Dharamsala on my way from Manali to Amritsar, but Gozde was heading there, and she and everyone made it sound like a must-see. So off I went, putting an unattractive kink into my route by doubling back east into Himachal.
 
Gozde and I were escorted to the bus station at an ungodly hour by her Sikh friend Vismeet, who presented us with thoughtful but exceptionally impractical parting gifts: Light-up Golden Temple plaques and a coffee table book of Punjabi temples. Both have since found new homes in guesthouse libraries.
 
We took our first bus to Pathankot, where we changed vehicles for the windy road to Dharamsala. It ended up being a very Indian journey: the time on the bus seemed absurd compared with the distance we covered on the map ("Just a couple of millimeters...How can that take ten hours?"). Gozde complained that the Indian passengers invaded her space much more than they did mine, which I think was true. The people standing in the aisle had a tendency to swing their bags into your mouth or hang their walking sticks where they clopped you in the head with every jostle of the vehicle.
 
Dharamsala actually refers to an anonymous town at the foot of a large hill. Our real destination was McLeod Ganj, which is splashed along the hilltops above Dharamsala. McLeod is on the world's radar thanks to its most esteemed residents, the Dalai Lama and his exiled Tibetan government.
 
As expected, the streets were populated by hippies in flowy clothing as much so as by the monks, who were inevitably uniformed in orange robes with a long umbrella tapping along the cobblestones. Everyone who has ever entertained an interest in Buddhism has surely contemplated a visit to McLeod.
 
Gozde had a knack for finding lesser-known gems among the overflow of cafes and guesthouses--I think it had something to do with the Turkish guidebook she was always thumbing through. Our cheapo hostel had views across the colorful McLeod roofs to the next hilltop, and her choice of restaurant served the first and only excellent Tibetan food I've ever had, including homemade everything, from brown bread to yogurt.

By total serendipity, I met two girls in this restaurant who also went to school in New England. Shaheen, from Mumbai, and Tsechi, from Seattle, were meeting their friend Tenzin, a Portlander who was enrolled in a Tibetan language and Buddhism course in Dharamsala. "Tenzin," by the way, is the Buddhist "Mohammed" as far as names go, because it is the current Dalai Lama's given name. This Tenzin took us out to one of McLeod Ganj's hot local restaurants, where we had sinfully good Bhutanese food. That spicy cheese sauce is still one of my happiest culinary memories from India, and never mind it wasn't Indian at all.
 
The next day, we four explored the countryside surrounding McLeod, replete with waterfalls, Israeli hangouts, misty villages and promises of spiritual fulfillment: Advertisements to find you a volunteer placement, repair your didgeridoo or help you see past the profane veil of the material world. In the final village, at the foot of a long waterfall, I ran into Dor from Manali, his hands happily wrapped around an Indian flute.
 
It was in McLeod, of all places, that I went to my first Indian club. The music turned off by 10, I believe, leaving the expat crowd to wander off in search of the afterparty. There were a couple such clubs in town, although a Tibetan had been beaten at one and the ensuing boycott ensured that no one went to that one.
 
The Tibetan community was thoroughly and obviously close-knit. Shaheen and I were often left as outsiders while we watched Tsechi and Tenzin, the Tibetans, realize they both both knew so-and-so in Canada whose cousin had interned with the Tibetan government five years ago. I have a mental image of gossip flying through a mid-sized town of people that's spread across the whole world.

Gozde had moved on to Rishikesh and the others had dispersed, so I ventured alone to the Dalai Lama's monastery. It sat just past the main part of town, next to a billboard displaying photos of the 100-plus Tibetans who have self-immolated in the name of independence. Many wore monk's robes, and the young faces far outnumbered the old.
 
Another board featured a headshot of a young boy, with the caption "Where is Panchen Lama?"  The religious leader was taken by the Chinese in 1995 and has not been seen since--he's often called the world's youngest political prisoner.
 
Considering that the Dalai Lama ostensibly inhabits it, the monastery at McLeod was fairly unassuming. The entrance opened onto a courtyard with mountain views dropping off on both sides. Inside the upstairs chambers, the walls were bedecked with Buddhist murals, which a hopelessly dense informational plaque failed to elucidate. A few people sat on the floor in meditation. Below the murals, framed photographs of the Dalai Lama sat amid stacks of biscuits, instant noodles, energy drinks and small bills. I always find it strange to see important shrines honored with the contents of someone's convenience store shopping list, but I suppose the point is to offer whatever you can.
 
The scene outside in the courtyard was a mixture of skittish and serene, as monkeys scuttled across the rooftops  and batted at tree branches while a group of monks chanted afternoon prayers. Channelled through the courtyard's acoustics, the chanting sounded solemnly rich and full-bodied.
 
There was, of course, no sign of the head monk, the Dalai Lama himself. He's apparently quite reclusive unless he's giving a public teaching.

I had an invitation from Tsechi to visit her father' s village, where she would be spending most of the rest of the summer. It was a dot on the map three hours south of Dharamsala called Tashijong. Her mother hailed from nearby Bir, a world-famous spot for hanggliding.
 
I stepped off the bus the next morning into a much quieter corner of Himachal. Tsechi met me at the bottom of the hill and we climbed up the lone paved road into Tashijong's center.
 
Tashijong peeks through flowering shrubs across a green Himachali valley. A monastery overlooks the village, home to a reclusive religious leader who seems to spend much of his time on the Buddhist monk equivalent of sabbatical. Tashijong's population is a mixture of Tibetan refugees, Indians and Tibetans who lived there long before the diaspora.
 
Tsechi's house sat along the hillside in the residential part of town. It was a busy day there:  Half a dozen monks were at work on her balcony, carefully wrapping prayer scrolls in orange strips of cloth . In her front yard was a partially constructed stupa, its top open to show the space where the prayer scrolls would be placed and sealed into the structure. The stupa was in the memory of enter grandfather. A previously completed one sat alongside it.
 
I sat in on the English class Tsechi taught at a local school. Her students were bright-faced little monks, aged between five and sixteen. Most of them were neither Himachali nor Tibetan--they hailed from Ladakh, Nepal and Arunachal. They behaved much like any little kids in school do, so it was slightly fascinating to see them already in monk's robes. Most, I believe, came from poor families, so the monastic life was a necessity and not a choice.
 
Back at the house, I was lucky enough to meet Tsechi's family, particularly her father, who was among the final generation to be born in a free Tibet.  With the Chinese invasion of '59, his family fled into northern India, where the Dalai Lama and many other Tibetans had found refuge. Life was hard. He spent his youth begging and working as a construction laborer, one of the dirt-grimed emaciated faces I saw all the time driving past the construction sites in Ladakh. His luck changed while working as a servant at a local palace hotel: He met and befriended an American man, who helped him relocate to Seattle.
 
As a child, Tsechi's father peddled spices on the streets of Amritsar. 40 years later, they returned as a family and stayed at the Amritsar Hyatt. That would be a neat ending to a perfect American Dream story, except that Tsechi's father will probably never live to see a free Tibet again. My generation might not either, and if not us, then the memory of what Tibet was may be too distant for it to exist again. At this point, Tibet is endangered as much by a diaspora population that grows further apart from its homeland every generation as it is from China's cultural smothering. There are Tibetans in India, in Canada, in Switzerland, some living lavishly and some eking by, but all growing more like their homes and less like their homeland. I think this is why many Tibetans feel compelled to marry within their community. Even Tsechi said she would not be opposed to an arranged marriage.
 
Add on to this the existence of an anti-Dalai Lama sect of Tibetan monks (probably funded and backed by a certain government), and a division within the Tibetan community about their demands for independence (the Dalai Lama officially endorses a "middle road" approach that involves autonomy but not independence, which isn't radical enough for many), and I had a lot to think about on the ride to Shimla. Tsechi quoted her dad saying something that particularly stuck with me: "In America I'm an immigrant, in India I'm a refugee, in Tibet I'm a foreigner. I just want to belong somewhere."
