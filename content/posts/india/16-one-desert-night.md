I wanted an "Arabian Nights" experience out of Jaisalmer and I wasn't too disappointed. Perched out in the Great Thar Desert, much closer to Pakistan than to any major Indian city, it was a 15-hour bus haul west of Jaipur.
 
A network of streets runs through the dusty sand-colored town that surrounds Jaisalmer fort, but otherwise there's just a pleasing dry emptiness in every direction. The labyrinthine fort rises above the surroundings on a modest hilltop. The proportions weren't epic--you could walk around the perimeter of the walls in 20 minutes, at least at my stride.  But the crenelations, dark windows and towers, home  to hundreds of roosting birds, were striking.
 
The real winner, however, came upon entering the fort along a steep ramp, as the structure rose above and you had to crane your neck to see the tops of the towers. Then you entered the cobweb of streets and found them bustling with activity: people sticking their heads out of windows, laundry (and tourist crap) hanging out to dry. A few thousand people still live crammed into Jaisalmer fort.
 
My guesthouse, five minutes from the walls, was run by a slightly sleazy manager known for hosting rooftop drinking socials. He invited me to "totally awesome party, whisky party, beer party" soon after I walked in, but looking around I didn't think there was a sufficient critical mass of guests to support such an endeavor.
 
There was an excellent crowd there, though. I was sitting on the rooftop one afternoon with a book when a young-looking British guy with a beard sat down next to me, crossed his legs, glanced at me, opened his mouth, and talked for the next 45 minutes. And he was hilarious, the kind of storyteller that I think can only be bred in Yorkshire pubs.
 
There were also a couple of Australians who had been forced to cut their trip short because they'd spent all their money on tailored clothes in Udaipur.
 
"The vendors were like 'Very very cheap!' and we were like, 'Shit, they are, really,'" the male Australian said sheepishly, not too bummed for someone who had traded two weeks in Sri Lanka for a tailored suit.
 
Add onto this two frowning Italians who talked with their hands, and there was potential fora festive atmosphere. This being India, however, there was nowhere to go except remain on our guesthouse roof with our less-than-appealing manager.

Throughout most of the country, alcohol ranges from expensive and inconvenient to completely illegal (in which case the proprietor will charge extra and ask you to keep the bottle under the table). In some places, a large bottle of Kingfisher costs as much as a crummy room, and as such is out of the question for budget-minded travelers like myself.
 
That's fine, because the universal Indian brew--Kingfisher--in its light form is as appealing as Keystone. Certainly no one comes to Jaisalmer for the drinking scene.
 
What they come for is a two-hour ride on the back of a camel on a desert safari around the surrounding dunes. The word "safari" is used really liberally and frequently by Indian tourist outlets, and rarely refers to anything as wild or adventurous as you imagined.
 
I went out to sample the travel agencies offering camel rides. I'd heard to avoid the popular Sam Dunes--they were apparently as secluded and untouristed as Disneyland.
 
By a stroke of good luck, on my way back, I ran into a British couple--James and Sally-- and a Guatemalan guy--Mariano--from my guesthouse, who were on their way to meet some desert local about a camel ride. I tagged along impulsively.
 
Mariano confirmed what I'd heard about Sam: the dunes were full of trash and played host to a practical caravan of abusive camel drivers who were ready to kidnap you to get you on the back of one of their steeds. He hoped that his desert contact could do better.
 
After a few minutes' wait at the prearranged meeting point, the contact appeared out of the darkness from up the street: A white-robed man with a sultan's mustache and a checkered purple and white turban. His name was Kheta, and he sold himself as a native desert man who came into Jaisalmer only every so often. We later debated how much of this was true, and how much was played up for the tourists. But he claimed to offer a camel ride to a secluded spot, virgin desert, and all of our ears pricked up at that. We agreed to meet the next day and, to my unease, paid him a portion in advance.
 
Watching Kheta's retreating back before he disappeared into the winding back alleys, it occurred to me that he might have just made some very easy money.
 
But the next day, in the bright sunlight of late morning, Mariano, James, Sally and I hopped into Kheta's jeep and drove past the dusty roadside bazaars, out into the scrubby surroundings.
 
As is often the case, the landscape wasn't quite as magnificent as imagined--The Great Thar Desert isn't the Arabian peninsula and sand dunes are few and far between. Bristly grasses and brambly trees claw their way out of the stony soil, and there are power lines and distant wind turbines overhead. I've heard that the turbines are there primarily to power the military bases along the Pakistani border, in case Pakistan decides to pull a Pearl Harbor.
 
Along the way we came to a desert village, long abandoned, allegedly because a local lower-caste girl refused to marry an upper-caste man, and the entire community emptied out of fear of reprisal. Folklore or not, I don't know, but the more I glean about this omnipresent but hidden aspect of Indian culture the more plausible it seems.
 
Eventually we pulled up along four reclining camels, and a couple of men attending them. We had stopped before so that Kheta could pick up a bottle of desert whisky, a kind of local moonshine that the desert people drink with lemon. We four paid for it, but we each had about two sips before Kheta's brother drank the entire bottle around the campfire that night.
 
During that camel ride I had two great revelations.
 
The first was about the miracle of turbans. Mariano and I had picked up 5-meter strips of brightly colored cloth from a local tailor. Kheta wrapped them expertly, so that I looked like a technicolor Quirrell from Harry Potter.
 
And my god, was my head cool the entire day. We had timed our ride to avoid the hottest time of day, but the sun beat down nonetheless, as the tops of my thighs can attest. In such heat, my head would normally be a Niagara Falls of sweat. Yet not a single drop escaped to my face. In fact, I don't think I sweated at all. Short of seeing some kind of scientific diagram explaining the physical properties of the turban, I'm not sure how it worked. The material was extremely thin and well-ventilated, only one step up from tissue paper.
 
Incidentally, although we all associate turbans with Muslims in the Middle East, in India if you see a turbaned person you can be quite sure that they are not Muslim. Kheta was Hindu. Muslims in India typically where the skullcap called the taqiyah, or topi in Hindi.
 
My second revelation was that camels are not designed to comfortably seat human beings. This was extremely clear by an hour into the ride, as my legs, splayed over the camel's wide back, began to fall out of their sockets. Mariano's camel, a frothing, berserk thing, had tried to throw him, and Mariano was now walking alongside. The other three of us were very jealous. James's camel, behind mine, was scratching his nose on the back of my camel's saddle and giving itself a nosebleed.
 
As it began to get dark, we could see the dunes ahead of us. It was about time. I was so uncomfortable I was on the verge of an out-of-body experience. When I finally lurched off my camel's back, I felt as though bamboo poles had been strung along the insides of my legs.
 
But it was worth it for these dunes. They were only a small patch, but there was barely a man-made object in sight for 360 degrees. The desert men built a fire while we sat recovering. They were very local people, and many had clearly not been much further afield of Jaisalmer. As one of them said, "This dune is my Jodhpur, that dune is my Delhi."
 
The exception is the town of Pushkar, which hosts an enormous camel fair every year, during which thousands of merchants and drivers converge to buy, trade and sell. Kheta makes the 25-day ride from Jaisalmer to Pushkar every year. I imagine an x-ray of his legs would reveal some interesting anomalies.
 
We laid our sleeping mats out on a dune, which are actually very hard-packed and not soft at all. But it didn't matter, because the sky was one of those that can only be seen when the nearest electric light is miles away. It was incredible.
 
In the morning, we gritted our teeth and rode back. On the way back to Jaisalmer, Kheta stopped off to show us a gypsy encampment:  just a few concrete buildings, a little grove of trees and a couple of bedraggled dogs. On seeing tourist blood, the gypsies themselves emerged, three middle-aged women in bangles and brightly-colored clothes with young children in tow. The men were out hunting. The women sang, danced and clapped, and practically reached into our pockets for money. It was extremely uncomfortable.
 
In this context, I think "gypsy" means a semi-nomadic, professional beggar with no other livelihood, people who have no perceivable option but to carry on the lifestyle of their desert-dwelling ancestors. Kheta told us that these gypsies came from the second-lowest caste in the region, out of seven. We all but fled back into the jeep as those ring-cluttered hands wracked over our pockets.
 
I'd originally pictured three desert nights, journeying deep into the desert like Peter O'Toole. But driving back into the Jaisalmer, into relative civilization, I decided that one was enough.
