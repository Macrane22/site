Standing on my guesthouse roof in Jodhpur, looking across the cluttered blue of the old city while the sky darkened and the wind blew ominous clouds over Mehrangarh, is the closest I think I'll ever be to feeling like I'm in *The Lord of the Rings*. Mehrangarh, Jodhpur's fortress, looms over the old city in a far more menacing way than Jaisalmer's does. It's huge, and the cliff it occupies is unscaleable.
 
I hadn't planned to come to Jodhpur at all, but I changed my mind and decided to drop by for one day. Mariano and I had selected a guesthouse in a quiet part of the old city, one blotchy blue tower of stone and plaster among many others. The buildings were painted blue and violet, from what I hear, because in olden times only the wealthy could afford that particular hue.
 
Stepping out of our winding neighborhood of shaded cobblestone streets, Jodhpur quickly became a bustling and sweaty urban space. I liked it. Unlike in Jaipur, I saw little modernity: No hideous concrete overpasses, no five-storey prefab office buildings that looked like set pieces from a children's play (it wasn't uncommon to see a building with a facade painted to look like it was made of something sturdy, only to move ten degrees to one side and find that beyond the front inch, the whole thing was a crumbling shambles).
 
The feel of Jodhpur was appealing, but as is often the case, Mehrangarh was less impressive from the inside than the outside. After I'd paid the entrance fee and joined the coiling crowds, I found myself in a mediocre museum, albeit with impressive views. Unlike Jaisalmer, it wasn't possible to actually mount the battlements or wind through a human ecosystem living within the fort's walls. I had lunch with Mariano on a guesthouse rooftop in Mehrengarh's shadow that boasted a single stove burner manned by two idle cooks.  Then it was time to go.

I had been excited for a while about Udaipur, which I awoke in the midst of, on a bus bouncing over Rajasthan's worst road. There was green all around me. I had escaped the semi-arid landscape of Jaipur and Jodhpur and reached Rajasthan's lush southern reaches.
 
On its placid lake, Udaipur's white old city looked closer to Northern Italy or Stockholm than to anywhere I'd been in the previous two months. Not that I've actually been to Northern Italy or Stockholm; however, the elegant marble buildings lining the water and the green hills were refreshing. Many people have seen this landscape without knowing where it is: the Bond film Octopussy was mostly filmed around Udaipur's iconic sites.
 
Floating in the middle of the lake, just far enough away to keep the guests isolated from the riff-raff on shore, was the white marble island of the Taj Lake Palace, one of India's most iconic hotels. Bond floats over to the Taj in a crocodile suit and finds it inhabited by a harem of giggling models, but nowadays it's only inhabited by people willing to shell out $1,200 for a night's stay.
 
My stomping grounds were just up the lake from the Taj, centered around a little white footbridge that spanned a particularly narrow neck of water.
 
Udaipur was the first place of my journey where I really had to ponder my choice of guesthouse: There was actually more than one that had enough merits to warrant my consideration. They were all thirty seconds from one another, on one side or other of that footbridge.
 
I heaved myself into the first one, passing a disheveled heap sleeping on a mattress in the lobby, and sat in on the rooftop for an hour looking out over the lake in the early morning light. For company I had a French mother and daughter, the latter of whom was recently arrived from a volunteer position in Gujarat. They were big fans of America and, naturally, big fans of Obama.
 
Nearly everyone I met was a big fan of Obama. When a tuuk-tuuk driver or Indian passerby asked me where I was from, and I replied with the typical "USA," they would as often as not give a big "America! Obama!" reply, accompanied with a thumbs-up.
 
"You like Obama?" I'd ask them.
 
"Obama good!" Another thumbs up.
 
This happened all the time. Many of the Europeans I met were similarly inclined and not much more eloquent. In the end, it seemed to come back to Obama being a good guy. They were usually quick to spit on Bush as well, six years after the end of his era. I encountered much the same thing in China around the 2012 elections, when the Chinese unanimously approved of Aobama, because he was handsome as much as anything else, but were ambivalent about Luomeni.
 
Anyway, we sat on the rooftop for a while looking over the city, and the sleeping heap from the lobby, who turned out to be the manager, served up drinks. Then, having weighed my options for more than an hour, I decided to take a room at the place next door to save 50 rupees.
 
Things fell into a pretty comfortable routine after that. Mariano showed up the next day from Jodhpur and took the room above mine.  In the mornings, I strolled across the footbridge to a
guesthouse roof on the opposite side for an hour of yoga-lite with the round and balding resident instructor. Here I met Fin, a New Zealander on a quick two-week jaunt around India. I also ran into Martin, a middle-aged German fellow who had been one of my companions in Manali.  Martin tended to talk in three or four-word bursts, but had a big smile and demeanor to make up for it.
 
There was more toe-wiggling than sweating in these yoga sessions. The teacher would sit on his map in the center of the students and say, "Now this exercise good for constipation problem," the teacher would say from his mat. "Do this in morning twenty times, drink cup of hot water and never have constipation problem." During the exercise that was supposed to burn fat from the sides of the stomach, he looked us all over thoughtfully, pinching our sides speculatively. He nodded approvingly at the plump French girls across from me, but told me that I had some flab to get rid of.  He always ended the lessons by leading us in a good hearty laugh, which seemed a fitting way of wrapping them up.

Returning from the other side of the lake meant walking over the footbridge, and I always passed the same few human landmarks along the way. First was the beggar with crippled and shrunken legs who kneeled on a rolling board and always looked up at me with pleading eyes. I never game him any money, even as I was crossing the footbridge for the last time with my backpack, and he knew I was leaving and said "Last time, last time," as I walked past.
 
Sometimes there would be a rickshaw driver next to him, one of the pushier ones I encountered, wearing a skeleton t-shirt and gesturing emphatically at his vehicle. He wanted my business every time but never got it.
 
On left side of the bridge, a woman had cloth handbags laid across a blanket. Sometimes her little daughter laid across the blanket as well. At other times, the mother rested and the daughter took up the job of peeping out "Bag, sir?" as I passed by. Across from them, a woman did the same thing with her silver necklaces and pendants, under drooping electrical wires that looked fully capable of electrocution.
 
After this I had to push my way through a little turnstile gate at the end of the bridge, the stupidest addition to a public space I have ever seen. Even I had a hard time squeezing through the thing, and I got stuck once or twice with my backpack. I suppose I have flabby sides, though. I should have hung around to watch an obese person try to get through, but I hadn't seen one in two months.
 
The cobblestones on the other side smelled like urine, and there was sometimes a young Indian guy posted up on along a stone wall catcalling at female tourists. He was a waiter at one of the restaurants along the water, where we would sit for breakfast and watch the local ladies trundle down to the water, sometimes in groups of 30 or more, to do their laundry. Indian women must be the brightest-dressed demographic group in the world. The pinks, oranges, blues and greens to me always reflected the bustle and clamor of the Indian streets but made it beautiful at the same time.
 
Our hostel was on the other side of the restaurants. I generally made a beeline for the rooftop terrace, where a bearded staff member was often posted up learning curse words from the guests in their native tongues. I heard him talking with a Spanish man, giggling and scribbling down words like "puta" and "culo" in a little notebook, while the Spanish guy's wife slept in her chair next to them.  This bearded worker had another notebook of reviews and testimonials from previous guests that he liked to take out and show people. I'm not sure for what, because he didn't sell anything, except to collect words of praise in different languages ("El es un buen tipo!"). He was clearly very proud of it.
 
Not everyone was so humorous about some of the staff's conduct. Three Israelis who I played cards with on the rooftop ended up changing hostels. The male Israeli told me that the workers had acted inappropriately towards his female companions.
 
It was too bad they moved, because they were a very friendly trio, and genuinely excited that I was from Seattle: Like Barack Obama, Seattle's grunge scene is almost universally appreciated overseas. As one of the Israelis told me, "That was the music from our childhood." Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden.  She told me she was disappointed that Eddie Vedder had weighed in unfavorably on the Israel-Palestine conflict, because politics and music shouldn't mix.  But I think I have a new pride in the grunge scene I didn't feel before, as it has been a musical appreciation shared among all the travelers I've met, on a level with Pink Floyd and the Beatles.
 
Descending the rooftop and exiting my hostel away from the lake, the activity on the narrow streets thinned out, with fewer shops and fewer people. There might be a couple of kids walking around outside, trying to get me to visit their father's guesthouse or buy them a bag of chips. It was dispiriting sometimes.
 
That was the walk I did at least once a day, until it was burned into my memory. I was only in Udaipur for a week, but in the context of my trip, as people and places have flown by like gusts of wind, that's a long-term residency.
