Among the backpackers of India who claim to be veterans, there are at least three pieces of prevailing wisdom about Agra.
 
The first is that spending the night there is a clear-cut sign of a traveler noob: After all, the prevailing opinion goes, functionally Agra is just the outer shell of the Taj Mahal, and there is nothing else in the city worth considering. The modus operandi is to catch a late-night train, show up in Agra in time to catch the Taj early, and have your rear end on another train by the time it's dark.
 
But I didn't have much of a choice on this matter, as my train from Mumbai rolled into Agra after dark, much too late to see the great building. Thus it was that I spent a night there, in the Taj Ganj traveler ghetto, a network of alleys that snaked past cafes, travel agencies and hotels.
 
The second prevailing opinion is that Agra is a dump, but Taj Ganj seemed quite pleasant to me. My guesthouse's rooftop had a clear view of the Taj Mahal, which I think is a requirement for any establishment that wants to stay in business in Agra. I had dinner up there and eyeballed the building's famous silhouette, cockeyed from this angle but still familiar. The evening air was cool, and I was looking forward to stepping into that postcard the next morning.
 
I almost laughed aloud when the guesthouse manager showed me my room. It was just a bed sandwiched between two walls, without a scrap or stitch of additional furniture or decoration. The room was long and narrow, like a corridor, and the bed was stuffed into the far end. Usually cheap places like this made at least a small effort to make their rooms appear livable, by throwing in a spindly table and a plastic chair, and maybe a cheap painting. Perhaps this particular guesthouse was aware that most travelers only want a bed for a few hours before they jog down to the Taj and then dip out of the city forever.
 
At this point in my trip, my clothes were beginning to emit a sour, musty smell that I'd honestly never experienced before, and I pulled them out to hang along the back of the bed. Examining each item, I noticed that many of them had a white powdery substance on their back side. Horrified that my clothes had developed some kind of pernicious mold, I ran into the awful bathroom down the hall and spent 45 minutes feverishly scrubbing them down in the shower with a bar of soap. I put my clothes up to dry behind my bed again, and then discovered that they had picked up the flaky white substance once more. At this point I realized that the plaster was disintegrating from the walls onto everything I owned. Anything that touched a surface instantly took the outer millimeter of the wall with it.  I was physically tired from scrubbing, and flopped down on my bed in defeat.

The third piece of prevailing Agra wisdom is to catch the Taj at sunrise, to maximize the aesthetic appeal and avoid the crowds. Thus it was that at 5 am, I joined every Caucasian person in Agra in a groggy line in front of the main ticket window. This was the beginning of a series of frustrations. The man at the ticket window, the gatekeeper to the most famous building in South Asia, didn't have change. Nor did anyone standing in line, of course. At 750 rupees, the Taj is the most expensive sight in India by a long shot. But even the most mainstream-shunning traveler will pay the fee, and moreover do so with a 1,000 rupee bill, which the ticket officer was woefully unprepared for.
 
Once I had finally secured a ticket, further annoyance came at the security checkpoint. The guard allowed me to  bring my tablet into the Taj, but not the keyboard that went with it. Not willing to pay a fee and walk it myself to a distant storage locker, I carefully deposited the keyboard in a secluded shrubbery, to be collected later.
 
The Taj Mahal's custodians made everyone wait in line long enough to guarantee that we missed the actual sunrise, so that when the grand gate finally swung open, we walked in on the Taj in bright sunlight.
 
That wasn't a bad thing, because the Taj Mahal is beautiful (there, I said it). With that postcard view actually in front of me, I spent a few minutes turning my head away to stare at any mundane object, anything else, and then snapping my head back to that perfect scene of elegant color and shape. The tourists lining up for photos in front of the building threw off the symmetry, but as they included me, I couldn't really complain.

Inherent in that first piece of wisdom, to get out of Agra fast, is that there is little else worth seeing in the city. There is the Agra Fort, sure, but many travelers have just come from Delhi, where they have probably seen the Red Fort, which looks almost identical.
 
I didn't visit the Agra Fort. But Agra is clearly more interesting than people give it credit for.  Before my clothing scrubbing fiasco, I stepped out of my guesthouse for a stroll and came upon a little clearing where two of Taj Ganj's alleys branched apart to form an open 'V.' Muslim men in white skullcaps were setting up rows of plastic hairs in front of a temporary stage, and others were milling around or sitting down expectantly. Impulsively, I sat down in the back row.
 
As the audience grew, several men mounted the stage and sat down cross-legged along the back. All were dressed in all white with black beards. The friendly white-bearded man next to me learned over and whispered an explanation: An important cleric was visiting to give some kind of teaching. When I asked where the cleric was, the man gestured vaguely to the distance and said that he wasn't here yet. A young boy in all white took the stage and sang in a high falsetto. Another man recited a poem. There were readings from the Qu'ran, which, as the white-bearded man reminded me, only the very few who are educated in Arabic can read.
 
While one man was orating at the microphone, shouts and chanting came from behind the stage to the right. A line of mustached men burst onto the scene, bearing a wrapped body upon their shoulders. The man on the stage went silent, and the Muslims in the audience turned to stare as the men paraded past, still chanting.
 
"Hindus going to burning place," the old man next to me whispered.
 
As the Hindus passed by, the Muslims and I craned our necks to follow them down the road and out of sight. Then the oration continued, as though it had never paused, and I was hit by a sense of what a diverse country India is.
 
A tall and youthful man eventually stood up and walked to the microphone. He began speaking softly in Urdu, looking out into the distance.  But then his voice rose to a firebrand roar, and he jabbed the air with his finger, his eyes still set in the distance but fiery now. Never having seen a speech of this kind before, I was unfortunately and inappropriately reminded of a eulogizing Hitler. The man's tone softened, but then rose again into that unexpected but powerful rumble. I have little doubt that this was the distinguished cleric.
 
I looked behind me. Mine had been the back row when I first sat down, but I was now less than halfway back.  Besides a couple of police officers to our left who seemed to be monitoring the proceedings, there were no other non-Muslims in sight, and no women. Everyone in the audience wore skullcaps and most were garbed in all white. They all had as much of a beard as was possible for their given age. Apart from that, their appearances and body language varied as widely as those of any other audience. Several rows in front of me, three teenagers, wearing beanies instead of skullcaps, were slouched in their seats texting.
 
I left during a lull in the cleric's rhetoric. I hadn't understood a word, but I was left with the clear impression that there was much more to this city than the Taj Mahal.
