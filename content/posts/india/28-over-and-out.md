It’s hard to look back on those last few days in Calcutta without thinking how much I’d like to go back.  Yet this is a sharp contrast to how I felt when I was there.  I was tired, unaccompanied and slightly under the weather for the first time.
 
I had culled the bottom of the guesthouse barrel in my search for a room, ultimately choosing a place that Lonely Planet heralded as “unfriendly but bearable” over the one it noted only as “deeply depressing.”
 
Needless to stay, I didn’t spend much time in there.  Instead, I wandered much of Calcutta’s downtown and central district.  I made the most of my last few days of Indian cuisine, eating every meal at one of two or three restaurants in the Sudder Street area where my guesthouse was located.  The options were doubly plentiful and appealing after five days of Nagamese food:  Creamy masalas, freshly squeezed juices, and Calcutta’s famous khati rolls.
 
I spent much of my final day trying to dispose of my last few hundred rupees, which weren’t going to do me much good in Thailand.  To that end, I walked down one of the streets that connected the guesthouse district with the busy bazaar just beyond.  The whole block was lined with beggars, their bedding and cookfires interspersed every ten feet along the sidewalk.  I stopped in front of a woman who had been calling out to me for the past couple days.  Her baby daughter was sprawled out on a blanket, legs kicking in the air.  The woman had a well-rehearsed story of misfortune.  That isn’t to say that I thought it was untrue, just that it was clearly well-oiled for the ears of the tourists who frequented that block.
 
I agreed to buy her a portion of raw rice and daal for the following morning, which would leave me just enough cash for a bus to the airport.  When I returned with the groceries in hand the next morning, the woman was nowhere to be found.  I asked for her by name, and left the food with a smiling man who promised to deliver it to her.  I knew full well that he wouldn’t.  Sure enough, as I walked down the block for the final time later that day, backpack on, the woman called out to me resentfully.  None of the food had reached her.
 
I stopped for a moment and then kept walking.  I was on the way to the airport.  And I was ready to leave.

I knew at the time that I’d miss the food:  After all, I’d been happily vegetarian for much of my Indian sojourn.  I can hardly think of a higher compliment for a cuisine than that.  But I didn’t give much thought to all of the other things I was leaving behind.  During the long taxi ride from the Bangkok airport to my hostel, I goggled out the window at the orderly streets, the blocks of manicured skyscrapers and apartment buildings.  It was refreshing and familiar.  It was anticlimactic.
 
My two-and-a-half months in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam were dominated by mishaps, misadventures and free-flowing hedonism.  Hostels had multiple beers on tap.  I rarely went half an hour without encountering a foreigner.  What a fun and memorable period it was.  But at only one or two fleeting points did I recapture the intangible thrill, the potent sense of adventure I felt every day in India.
 
A year later, I still haven’t.  Suffice it to say that I’ll be back.
