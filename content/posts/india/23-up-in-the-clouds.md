Calcutta is India's third city, a Los Angeles-sized metropolis that is more synonymous with poverty in the Western mind than anywhere else in the world. It's a place that ought to leave an imprint of some sort.
 
But I slept-walked through my days there. My most memorable encounter of that period came not in Calcutta itself but on the Varanasi station platform waiting for the Calcutta train. A white guy around my age with long hair flowing to his shoulders caught my eye, a common occurrence when two Caucasian people are in a foreign crowd. There's always an immediate bond in that look, a mutual understanding that you are two of a kind.
 
He introduced himself as Alex. Alex looked like Jesus and talked with the kind of untarnished, wide-eyed sincerity that I imagine Jesus himself did. He was three years into a journey that had taken him to every inhabited continent, and was heading to Calcutta to meet his Russian wife. Alex was writing a book based on his journey, which he hoped would transform the way humans interact with one another. You see, he explained to me, in the olden days, religion was the force that bound society together into a cohesive unit. But in our brave new world, capitalism has taken on the role previously inhabited by religion. If people unite under the leadership of a church of capitalism, invest in it the mental and emotional resources previously reserved for religion, our society will regain the cohesion and compassion that the modern age has swept away. Or something.
 
He talked so sincerely that it very nearly made sense. When the train screeched onto the platform, he gave me a hug and wished me a "safe journey, brother," picked up his guitar and disappeared from my life forever.
 
The journey from Varanasi to Calcutta is a 12-hour ride east into India's geographic armpit on the Bay of Bengal. I met my friend Morgan without a hitch in the Calcutta train station, and we hired an old-fashioned yellow cab into the city.
 
We picked a guesthouse very close to the headquarters of Mother Theresa's Calcutta mission, in the dense haven of guesthouses and travel agencies around Sudder Street. The network of alleyways led on to more open streets and a large market where India's population density frothed in all its glory.
 
Delhi was a sweaty and dusty hellhole; Mumbai was an oceanside metropolis that sometimes felt like a collection of villages. Calcutta should have been the third installment in this series of epic Indian cities, but left me with little to describe it one way or the other.
 
Maybe some of the novelty of the Indian city had worn off. Or maybe my apathy was a self-fulfilling prophecy: Neither Morgan nor I had particularly wanted to go to Calcutta, but it was a natural and necessary stopover on the way into the Northeast. We didn't try particularly hard to like it.

The first challenge of the journey to Darjeeling was finding the bus. The vehicle in question sat in a bus lot lost in the tangle of Calcutta's urban jungle. Through the usual frenetic process, Morgan and I dodged taxis at intersections, yelled at cops for directions over the scream of a hundred horns, followed pointed fingers back and forth, back and forth, and finally cut behind a fabric market into the bus stand.
 
We boarded the sleeper bus the only way it was possible to board a sleeper bus in India: with complete uncertainty. The facilities and standards of comfort on these things varied widely, and you couldn't know what awaited you until you stepped on the bus. There were no photos here, and certainly no reviews.
 
This one had double-decker bunk compartments made of the same material as a doctor's examining table. Thin curtains pulled across three quarters of the compartment's length and allowed some privacy. This in itself was a significant improvement over many sleeper buses I'd seen. Morgan and I sat in compartments across the aisle from one another, reassured and pleasantly surprised. If I lay diagonally, I could fit most of myself in the compartment even when I was completely horizontal. This wouldn't be so bad.
 
At this point, an Indian man squeezed down the aisle to Morgan's compartment and told her that she was in his seat. They compared tickets, and sure enough, we had misinterpreted her number. Each compartment was intended for two people; our two tickets granted us only the one I was currently lying in.
 
So Morgan squeezed in next to me, and so began a very long ride. I couldn't lie flat without hanging my legs into the aisle or placing my feet up onto the wall in front of me. But the compartment was too short to allow me to sit up. I stuffed a windbreaker and a shirt into a pillow and folded myself as best I could.
 
Morgan, by the window, was soon coated in a layer of grime blowing in from outside. We didn't want to close it because the bus air was hot and sweaty as it was. But the wind would also periodically whip the window curtain across my face with surprising force. I roped it around the curtain pole and watched Calcutta pass by. We drove through handsome districts of fountains and canals. There was clearly much of this city that I hadn't seen.
 
I fell in and out of sleep for a vague and indeterminate length of time. The fifteen-hour ETA had us arriving sometime around 9 am. But when the viscous trickle of time finally presented morning, I spotted a place-name on a signboard of the town we were driving through. I squinted at the map of West Bengal in my guidebook and gaped. We were halfway there.
 
What happened during that time in the middle of the night, I may never know. But we could hardly have been driving.
 
And so we stared out the window at the West Bengal countryside of palms and thatched roofs. I wasn't tired enough to sleep, and I would rather be bored with my eyes open than closed.  Placards for the West Bengal communist party dotted the towns we passed through. The state, uniquely in India, was run by a communist government until recently for more than three decades.
 
At 6 pm, 24 hours after our departure, we pulled into the bus stand in Siliguri, under a darkening sky.
 
To be fair, we had taken a ten minute rest that afternoon, where I stretched my legs and where, Morgan claims, she saw the driver slip illicitly into a back room with a lady of the establishment. I can't back this up myself.
 
Siliguri was merely a stop-over, a concrete transit point that allowed easy access to Darjeeling. Signs of rapid expansion were evident: Our bus drove over an overpass that was squeezed on top of a slum, with barely a foot of space between the tin roofs and the concrete underside. As with all Indian urban spaces, the city felt close to bursting, with more activity per square meter than was possible in anywhere but India.
 
We hired a shared jeep, and the urban clutter fell away as we climbed up towards Darjeeling. Siliguri became a bed of twinkling lights in the valley below, and then disappeared entirely.

Darjeeling felt and looked very much like Shimla and Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh: Multi-colored roofs, half-obscured by whisps of cloud, poked along the ridges of green hills. Toy British churches, cobblestone streets and nineteenth-century houses peppered the view in every direction. Whatever the other legacies of their colonialism, the British could certainly build a mean hill station.
 
In Calcutta, Morgan and I had taken to speaking in Spanish whenever we were solicited by someone unwanted. It was a defensive tactic borne out of both of our weariness with dealing with strangers, mine from throughout my trip and Morgan's from two months of studying in the urban industrial snare of Uttar Pradesh.
 
But the residents of Darjeeling were benign and unintrusive.  I walked through street markets where vendors who caught my eye smiled at me; Morgan often stopped to chat in Hindi with wrinkled Darjeeling grandmothers with long braids who were returning home with shopping bags. I passed people on the street who were sharply dressed in Western fashion. It was almost culture shock.
 
The reason for this sea change in the locals' appearance and attitude towards foreigners was simple: We were no longer in India proper. Like Ladakh, Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, Darjeeling is inhabited by people whose language, ethnicity and demeanor are entirely separate from those of their countrymen farther south. Indeed, Darjeeling is at a fascinating place geographically. It sits on the chin feathers of the chicken neck that connects India's Northeast States to the country's main body. Depending on which direction you pivot towards, you can throw a stone from Darjeeling southeast into Bangladesh, west into Nepal, or northeast into Bhutan. Tibet isn't much farther.
 
Despite the warmth of its inhabitants, Darjeeling was caught perpetually in a cloud that blotted all color from the sky: the air was always damp, and views seldom extended to the next row of hills. In clear weather, Darjeeling boasts astonishing vistas, including a panorama of Mt. Khangchendzonga, the world's third-highest mountain.
 
Indeed, Darjeeling sits on the precipice of the Himalayas and is home to one of the most prestigious climbing schools in the world, the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute.
 
I visited the HMI one drizzly morning. Outside was a statue of its founder, Tenzing Norgay, one of the two first men to summit Everest, who lived in Darjeeling for much of his life. Inside were displays dedicated to early Everest expeditions, most of them failures. Old mountaineering equipment made of canvas and fabric, faded flags and artifacts from Norgay's and Hillary's legendary climb lined the display cases. In the upstairs gallery, strangely out of place, sat a large telescope that Adolf Hitler had gifted to the leader of Nepal's armed forces.

There was a small but close-knit group of backpackers in Darjeeling. We traveled in a pack, usually after rendezvousing in one of Darjeeling's bars (one of the two--we went on a pub crawl that hit both of them) or a well-liked cafe that served eggs and French toast.
 
Morgan and I were looking for a companion to join us in our journey to the Northeast States.
 
 
But no one else was heading there. Most of the other backpackers were stopping in Darjeeling en route to Sikkim, India's smallest state, a Himalayan nubbin sandwiched between Tibet and Bhutan. Others were coming to or from Nepal. But no one else was going to the true Northeast. We found this a little puzzling. It was as if, in everyone else's eyes, India's borders ended at Darjeeling and Sikkim. Nor did any of the travel agents in Darjeeling advertise anything in the Northeast.
 
One of our backpacker friends in Darjeeling, a top-knotted American named Chris, had passed through the Northeast States en route from Myanmar. Chris was midway through a cycling trip that he had begun in Thailand, with the intention of reaching Europe. I was excited to meet him: I had heard stories of people on intercontinental journeys like this, including one man walking from Europe to East Asia, whom two of my acquaintances had encountered in Delhi. But I had yet to meet anyone on a truly epic trip. To me, a continuous long-distance land journey sounds like the pinnacle travel.
 
Chris's description of the Northeast was a land empty of backpackers, full of wild landscapes and tribal peoples. The only foreigners he had met were anthropologists and photographers. It sounded interesting to me and Morgan. So we went.
