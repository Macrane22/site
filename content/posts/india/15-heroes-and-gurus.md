Jaipur's Raj Mandir is perhaps India's most famous cinema. Why it is in Jaipur, India's tenth city, instead of Bollywood capital Mumbai, I have no idea. I caught a 9 pm screening with a French-Canadian guy from my guesthouse named Alex. We were forsaking local celebrations for Krishna's birthday, which the Israeli documentarian from our hostel had scurried off to document last-minute with his twitchy shutter finger.
 
The line for tickets started forming outside the theater more than an hour in advance. The ticket window, of course, didn't open until shortly before the show began.
 
When the floodgates opened and we had hold of our tickets, we were ushered into a very handsome atrium. Indeed, it may have been the nicest Indian building I'd been in up to that point. People in semi-formal dress stood in little knots with drinks in their hands.  I felt like I was at a ballet. When the time came, we ascended a staircase to the lone screen and sat down in our assigned seats, just past two guards with rifles across their laps (a universal feature of Indian public spaces).
 
When the red velvet curtain lifted, the audience cheered. When the Bollywood darling female lead appeared on screen, the audience cheered. Indeed, the audience was boisterous and loud throughout the whole film. The guy on my left took a call on his cell phone during the first act, but no one noticed because of the general clamor.
 
In the States, we may have a couple moments during a showing when everyone cheers a little self-consciously and then goes quiet again. The Indians, however, interacted with the screen. This was a social event, one to which both the audience and the characters were invited to.
 
This wasn't the only novel thing. In Hollywood, the days of simple cop-and-robber movies are long over: John Wayne is much too straightforward a hero for our modern sensibilities. Good guys don't beat bad guys and ride into the sunset anymore. Plots, like life, are more complicated now. This may not be true for The Expendables, but fortunately I haven't had to see it yet.
 
But the Indian cop-and-robber flick I saw that night suggested a very different attitude towards heroism. Instead of John Wayne, the protagonist was a burly Mumbai police officer with a handlebar mustache and aviators. His name was Singham.
 
The whole movie was so slavishly laudatory of the "lionhearts" of the Mumbai PD that I wondered if money changed hands somewhere down the line, or if the studio was kissing the feet of some Mumbai worthy. Just as likely, though, is that this faith in law enforcement is the norm in India.
 
The villain was a jowly guru called Baba, who held court outside his extravagant ashram attended by a retinue of young Swedish women (or so they looked; Bollywood directors' penchant for sticking Caucasian people into the backdrops of their films is world-famous).
 
Baba was involved in some oily business dealings--there was a missing ambulance loaded with cash, the murder of a grandfatherly government official, and who knows what else. I should mention at this point that the whole movie was in Hindi, sans subtitles, so I gleaned what I could from watching Singham galumph around and Baba cackle.
 
Singham emerged from shoot-out after shoot-out without a scratch, and took the upper hand in a few very lame fight scenes that would have been at home in a mid-90s arcade game, complete with gravity-defying punches and accompanying sounds effects.
 
The middle of the film, I was relieved to see, featured a Backstreet Boys-esque ballad that Singham lip-synched to the best of his ability (not very well). I hope Bollywood never changes in this regard.
 
If all of this sounds like c-grade crap, I think it was. It's the kind of film that Roger Ebert would have torn apart in one withering and well-constructed sentence.
 
But Bollywood and Hollywood are parallel but separate universes, so I think evaluating them by the same metrics would be a mistake. Between the lines, the film's lack of subtlety and the audience's reaction to it were pretty interesting.
 
The film's devotion to law and order was un-American but understandable. I think we might have had much the same attitude shortly after 9/11. The 2008 terrorist attacks on Mumbai are probably still etched deep on the public's consciousness.
 
What really floored me was the movie's final quarter. A band of militants had blown up some of Singham's fellow cops with an IED, and Baba's followers had had some kind of collective temper tantrum and sacked Mumbai. They were of various ages and genders, their only uniting feature being the white robes of Baba's ashram. They were unarmed.
 
In the climactic scene, Singham and thousands of his fellow cops took to the streets, harrumphed to the site where the protesting ashramites had set up camp, and walloped the shit out of them with batons for a good five minutes of screen time. This was to loud shouts of approval and cheering from the crowd in front of the screen, who were happy to see the miscreants getting the stiff end of police justice.
 
At the end of the film (and during the intermission--the film actually had an intermission), I walked out into the atrium and looked around at people who didn't think it was strange to see their protagonist clubbing down unarmed civilians. I stood in a knot with Alex and two Dutch people, the only foreigners in the theater, all of us feeling very foreign indeed. (Except for Alex, who was asleep for most of the movie.)
 
As a postscript, corrupt guru Baba is clearly an incarnation of the cult-of-personality spiritual leaders that India has produced. Most famous is Osho, the anti-establishment guru with atypically liberal views on sexuality, who fled India in the eighties to establish a commune in the US (in Oregon, of course). Scandal forced him to pack up from there also, and after being denied entry into more than 20 countries he returned to India and died. His ashram in Pune, not far from Mumbai, is thriving. Thousands of people show up on the premises every year, where they don maroon robes and spend large sums of money to do extremely silly things. At least that's what I think from poking around the ashram's website. Among the offerings is a zen-tennis combination called zennis and various courses with names like "Living with Totality."
 
I weighed travelling to Pune to poke around the ashram, but even securing a one-day "meditation pass," as they call it, was prohibitively and pathetically expensive for an organization that aligns itself with high ideals. Baba's status as chief villain in the movie is easily explainable when you think about how the rigid Hindu establishment must view such spiritual profiteering. And many of Osho's followers, of course, are white people.
