There is nothing in the world quite like the border crossing between Wagah in India and Attari in Pakistan, the only legal opening between two countries whose enmity is legendary. It's quite miraculous, then, what happens at Attari-Wagah every single evening:  The border guards from both nations put on a joint circus of a show when they close off the crossing for the night. I’d heard of the ceremony’s pomposity and chest-beating before I arrived in India, and I couldn’t miss it.
 
I went with Gozde and Gurwinder. Jeeps herding Indian and foreign tourists to the border leave regularly from the Golden Temple, and the 45-minute drive west passed through the boxy concrete sprawl of greater Amritsar and into the countryside.
 
The jeep pulled up by a sea of stalls with snacks, knick-knacks and Indian flag facepaint on display. A tree-lined pedestrian avenue led ahead, flanked by banners singing the praises of India’s Border Security Force, the largest border guarding force in the world (“The Large…the Proud…the BSF”). Flanked by Indians walking on both sides of me, I felt like I was strolling to a baseball game.
 
Loudspeakers along the way were spitting out patriotic music mixed with announcements (“Beware of anti-national elements…Please use dustbins.”) At the security checkpoint, a guard with a Dalí mustache forced Gozde and me to part ways with Gurwinder, we in the foreigner section and he in the Indian bleachers.
 
The crowd was seated in stands along either side of the road that runs through the border.  To our right was an arched gate with "INDIA" spelled out on it next to a portrait of Gandhi. Armed guards manned towers on either side. To our left was Pakistan. They had a gate too. Theirs displayed Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the nation's founder and Gandhi's rival, whose thin and austere face was a striking contrast to Gandhi's warm and smiling one. Still on our left, halfway between Jinnah and Gandhi, was the border gate, over which the flags of both countries were flying.

In all, the whole affair lasted 45 minutes. As expected, it was the most outrageous and over-zealous display of nationalism I had ever seen. It started with a dance party: In the middle of the road, Indian and foreign women were moving their hips to "Jai Ho" and other similarly energetic numbers. Indian flags waved across the stands, while others dripped down the cheeks of some of the observers, but I noticed that most of the Indian crowd was quite reserved.  I'm not sure how much of that is inherent to Indians and how much was due to other factors: I've heard that many of the Indian supporters are bussed in from around the country to cheer on the motherland, like North Korean soccer fans.
 
An announcer, meanwhile, was waxing poetic about the valor of the Border Security Force. The BSF does indeed have a dangerous  job--they're deployed mainly along the Pakistani border and in the contentious Northeast States, in places rife with guerrillas, militias and illegal activity. But the BSF honor guards who were preening and pacing in front of us seemed unlikely to engage in anything that would rumple their uniforms.
 
The guards were all elaborately mustachioed and dressed to win a 19th century maharajah's costume ball: Decorated military uniforms that hung to the shins, with white ankleguards underneath that strapped around their black shoes, a red sash, white gloves and a type of headwear with a large white fan protruding from the top like a feather.
 
Groups of two people carrying an Indian flag were now running back and forth in front of us, mostly little kids. Half a dozen of the honor guard lined up in front of us; one of them shouted commands while the guards high-kicked and marched in place.
 
The Indian announcer let out a war-cry, "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" which was echoed by the announcer on the Pakistani side. A rapid drum beat began to sound, and then one of the guards turned on his heel and marched toward the gate, right arm karate chopping energetically. He reached the gate, high-kicked, and faced off with his Pakistani rival on the other side. The Pakistanis were similarly dressed to the Indians, with the same fan headwear, but they were garbed in black. The two harumphed around each, posing dramatically and throwing in a high kick or two. Then they exchanged a vigorous handshake and took up positions at their respective side of the gate, rigid-backed.
 
The announcer led the crowd in a rousing chant of "Hindustan! Hindustan!" Then the Pakistani announcer retaliated amiably, and the crowd on the other side let out a half-dozen full-throated cries of "Pakistan!" while the Indians waited quietly.
 
This all was repeated again and again as the remaining guards marched off to the gate one by one.  I could see turbaned forms on one side of the Pakistani stands--the men--and the women on the other. The sun began to set, silhouetting the figures standing on the Pakistani gate, waving flags and punching their fists in the air.
 
At last, once each guard had strutted in front of the gate and taken up a position in front of it, the ceremony closed: In unison, the Indian and Pakistani flags were lowered from the center, to cheers from the crowd. The drum beat started up again, and the guards marched back toward us in triumph.
 
The stands broke and everyone poured towards the gate to see the scene up close.
 
I thought that the whole thing was admirably, puzzlingly and maybe overly flippant, considering that India's and Pakistan's relations have included several wars, the threat of nuclear conflict, and most recently the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
 
Seventy years ago, no concept of 'Pakistan' existed; but when the Muslims in the Indian National Congress, led by Jinnah, refused to accept Gandhi's policy of nonviolence, as well as his vision of a unified India, the new and artificial border was created. I pity the British official who was given the task of actually drawing out the boundary. But with partition in 1947, the predominantly Muslim areas of India were hacked off into Pakistan and East Pakistan, later Bangladesh. Ten million people switched sides, as Sikhs and Hindus drained out of Pakistan and Muslims fled the other way. Skirmishes and violence along the way killed 500,000 people on both sides. At one point, Lahore rubbed shoulders with Amritsar as Sikhism's most important city; today a mere estimated 20,000 Sikhs remain in Pakistan. Kashmir is ongoing collateral damage.
 
That's a sobering bit of context for Attari-Wagah. On the other hand, I don't think if would hurt if all conflicted regions hosted a bit of spectacle like this to burn off some of the enmity.
