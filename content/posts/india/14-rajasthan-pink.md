Rajasthan is India's definitive tourist trail, the subcontinent equivalent of euro-tripping around, say, Amsterdam, Munich and Prague. The state has well-established circuits, reliable infrastructure, and the kind of architectural and historical sites that appeal to vacationing tourists. It's one of only two Indian states that has its own guidebook (the other being the much less appealing northern sprawl of Uttar Pradesh).
 
My descent into Rajasthan was marked by a sea change in the appearance and demeanor of my fellow travelers: gone were the long-term wanderers, the dreadlocked vegetarians and Buddhism aficionados. In their place were groups of eager ("keen," as they would say) Europeans on two-week package tours. At this point, a snobbier person than me would clear his throat and say something about the tourist vs. traveler dichotomy: somewhere, supposedly, there exists a magical line between someone who truly experiences a place's culture and someone who just observes it from the outside. For the most part, I do believe this. One of the themes of my whole trip has been the tension between enjoyment and authenticity, and the anxiety that many of us feel when we realize we're sacrificing much of the latter for the former. Few people, after all, want to be tourists. We all want to be travelers.
 
This was fairly difficult in Rajasthan, however, and I didn't try too hard to dig past the surface there. The big sites are well-insulated from their surroundings by all of the tourist infrastructure. Rajasthan was nothing if not straightforward: I didn't find the uncensored hell of Delhi or the spirituality of the north. But I did have a great time.
 
As every guidebook mentions in its introductory paragraph, Rajasthan is the "land of kings"-- the word comprises "Raj," meaning king, and the same -stan suffix that the Afghans, Tajiks, Uzbeks all employed to name their nations. A series of princely dynasties ruled here over the centuries and left behind India's most famous collection of forts, palaces and anything else that can charge an admission fee.
 
One of the first things people usually say about Rajasthan is, "it's so colorful there!" I heard this enough to expect the whole state to be a big technicolor explosion. Rajasthan's Big Four,  the most famous cities, are known colloquially, or at least in tourist pamphlets, by the hues that their old districts were painted: pink for Jaipur; white for Udaipur; blue for Jodhpur; and gold for Jaisalmer.

I started my journey in the Pink City. It turned out to be much more orange than pink, to a modern color palette. The buildings lining the wide streets of Jaipur's old city were painted an Adobe tint. I found it disappointingly ordinary for an "old city"--there were no winding back alleyways here, just clothing shops and markets through which schoolgirls in Burqas and disagreeable touts wound their way.
 
In the streets, rickshaw-wallahs sweated and struggled at the pedals of their vehicles. With proper nutrition they would have quads and calves the size of Lance Armstrong's, but they were invariably emaciated. It was hot, very hot. I'd seen my first camel midway along the bus ride from Delhi, and there were more here, lazily pulling carts through the roads under the driver's whip.
 
Forts are Rajasthan's forte, and Jaipur's is one of the most famous of the bunch. A few kilometers out of town, the Amber Fort's name has nothing to do with the material amber--the 'b' is silent. Also confusingly, it wasn't really a fort so much as a palace. But it was an impressive one, and I navigated the labyrinth of corridors and courtyards pretty unsuccessfully. I climbed up from Amber to Jaigarh, and actual fort that rode along the hills like a forgotten redstone section of the Great Wall of China. The views were awesome, and after skirting nervously around a group of monkeys I took a look at the world's largest wheeled cannon, which supposedly was fired once, a long time ago--the ball flew five kilometers. The fort also claimed to have the world's largest silver jars, but I elected to skip that one.

Jaipur had more interesting attractions than its old city. For one, there were the famous sweet shops clustered around my guesthouse. Indian sweets are not at all subtle--in some form or another, they're all dough or gelatin soaked in honey or syrup. They squirt liquid into your mouth when you bite into them and leave your teeth buzzing.
 
From one glance at the post-it testimonials downstairs, it was clear that my guesthouse of choice was a haven for the Japanese. They stayed up late in the rooftop garden outside my room, smoking and murmuring. I liked them more than some of the other guests, who included a brooding French stoner and a slightly abrasive Israeli documentarian. Three of the Japanese were staying in Jaipur for one full month. Not because they liked it--they shook their heads wide-eyed at that--but because they were there on business. I gathered that they were nomadic gemstone peddlers who bought their stones in Jaipur and then sold them on the streets of Chinese tourist towns like Lijiang and Dali.
 
Jaipur has its own universe of gemstone vendors and an accompanying universe of scams. Even our guesthouse had a large  collection on display, which could've been glass for all I know. The Japanese showed me some of their purchases, including turquoise and some other stuff I'd never heard of. "Stones," the most talkative of them said, looking down at them. "Stones. Mmmmm....stones, ahng. Stones...ahhm..........stones..." He was very friendly but not particularly eloquent in English.
 
He had a tendency to do that whenever the conversation ran out: he'd mull over the word, turn it over in his mouth thoughtfully: "Seattle, ahmmmm. Seattle, Seattle. mmmm..."  Take a drag on his cigarette, then, "Seattle, ahm mmm..."
 
"Mm, Seattle, uhhnng," one of the female Japanese would add.
 
I've hung out with enough foreigners now to appreciate the moment when they switch from their native language to English, so that I can take part in the conversation. It happens all the time, and makes me both admire their capacity to switch to a second language at all, and feel a little guilty, as if I'm handicapping the conversation.
 
On the other hand, by this point in India I was used to the language barrier leaving me in the dark. This was rarely more true than when Jaipur gave me my first taste of Bollywood cinema.
