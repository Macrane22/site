Journeying from Leh into greater Ladakh was not quite as straightforward as I had imagined, mainly due to my own indecisiveness. There were far too many valleys, monasteries and stretches of Himalayan scenery to see, and I couldn’t decide which I should see.
 
So I began wandering into the travel agencies stacked along Changspa, sometimes asking after one excursion and sometimes another, listening for the owners’ reactions and pricing. Thus it was that I ended up in a jeep one morning to Pangong Tso, the string-bean shaped lake east of Leh whose eastern half sits on the other side of the Tibetan border.
 
The two-hour drive over was dramatically scenic (but then, so is everything in Ladakh). This time my companions were two Dutch sisters, Lieke and Lisanne, aged a year on either side of me, which made them the youngest travelers I’d met so far. As is customary among India backpackers, we swapped Delhi horror stories—they were put through the travel agent scam mill in Paharganj also. We were supposed to have two Polish companions too, but they dropped out due to illness.
 
The Indian military remained a notable presence throughout the journey. We passed one military base during the climb up to the lake. Prominently in view along the road was a plaque that read
 
WE
LEAD BY EXAMPLE
LIVE BY CHANCE
LOVE BY CHOICE
AND
KILL BY PROFESSION
 
How’s that for an interesting piece propaganda:  A proclamation that acknowledges that death plays a role in war.
 
Another army base sat on the western shores of the lake, and upon passing through we received our first view of the water. Pangong rests at about 13,900 feet in a bowl of Himalayan mountains. The peaks directly surrounding it were barren and light brown, but the layer beyond had snowcapped crests. From the jeep window, the lake’s famous appeal was immediately obvious: It was so, so blue, the bluest body of water I’ve ever seen. The closest comparison that came to mind was the dark blue Gatorade flavor; on the other hand, the aquamarine shallows along the lake’s shores looked like they belonged at a beach in Phuket or Bali.
 
We took a room at the home of a very kind and soft-spoken local family. The homestay was in the village of Spangmik, a collection of tent camps and one-story houses rising up the gradual slope from the lakeshore. It was a village in the truest sense of the word—45 people, nine families. The husband of the family, who has lived in Spangmik his entire life, spoke Ladakhi, Tibetan, Nepalese, Hindi and decent English.
 
We sat cross-legged on cushions in their kitchen drinking tea and watching a Bollywood movie on their little TV. All of the features of a Bollywood film were there—1960s sitcom humor, indescribable transitions between dialogue and dance numbers—but I was most interested in the fact that this piece of mainstream South Indian culture was being broadcast in a place that did not resemble Mumbai whatsoever, to people who shared almost nothing culturally or ethnically with the Indians. A large photograph of Lhasa hung next to the TV, but the husband told me that he had never been to Tibet because the Visa requirements were so stringent.
 
Taking in the view outside, I met the senior male in the family, a stooped old man named Tashi who was 86 and looked it. Part of his longevity might be explained by the fact that he seemed to spend his life sitting in a plastic chair in the garden and squinting over the village and lake below. I joined him at his look-out spot for about ten minutes. Every time a jeep or motorcycle cruised into town he would point it out to me, with an approximation of the English word. The rest of the time he played with a strand of beads in his hand and hummed loudly to himself. I think he was praying, but I’m not sure.
 
I also had an experimental 30-second uphill jog, which left me gasping and wheezing. The thin air was clearly real: I woke up a couple times that night breathing deeply through my mouth, as though I hadn’t been able to collect enough oxygen while asleep.
 
The next morning we woke up at 5:25 to see the lake at sunrise, but discovered that having the sun directly overhead is what gave the lake its memorable blue hue. We lingered a couple hours to see that intense blue one more time. As we were departing, we passed through the army base at the lake’s edge. A soldier dressed in camo stopped our vehicle and passed us each a double handful of raisins through the window. I didn’t fully understand our driver’s explanation, but I believe it related to a Hindu tradition of some sort. There was a holy site nearby. Across the way was a stretch of grass fenced off with a DANGER, MINEFIELD sign.
 
Somewhat ironically, hanging out with Lieke and Lisanne meant that I learned as much about Dutch culture than I did about Ladakhi culture. I learned that the Dutch are often perceived as being very stingy, even among themselves, to the point that some of the shop owners around Leh can recite back the Dutch for “Just looking, I’m not going to buy it.” I learned that Volkert van der Graaf, the man who assassinated prominent Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002, was released from prison recently for “good behavior,” after serving just 11 years—they don’t believe in the death penalty there, or even life sentences. Hell, even their prime minister bikes to work.
 
Whereas our Santa Claus swoops in from the North Pole every Christmas Eve, the Dutch Sinterklaas travels much more practically: He arrives in Holland via steamboat from Spain around the second-to-last week of November. He then parades around the country until his birthday, December 5, whereupon he dispatches gifts to the children with the help of an army of little black men called Black Petes. There’s been a lot of debate recently about the racial undertones of this last part.
 
Most interestingly, the girls were completely incredulous of American patriotism and all the chest-beating that goes with it. It was an interesting reminder that I need not have gone all the way to India to encounter new points of view.

Lieke and Lisanne departed for Manali on a 1 am bus. The next day, not wanting to lounge around Ley, I tried to hire a moped (a scootie, as they’re called around here), but none was available. After a few frustrated minutes, I impulsively ducked into a bike shop and rented a bicycle.
 
My mountain bike was sturdy enough, but I felt self-conscious because I had a full-size bike pump strapped to the outside of my daypack—the shop had no smaller pumps in stock. So I zipped out of Leh on the southeast road, following the same path we had taken to Pangong. I was on my way to a couple of the monasteries in the surrounding countryside. It seemed irresponsible to visit Ladakh without seeing them. Against my impulses, I had to stay to the left, one of the more nefarious vestiges of British rule. But going this direction, at least, the road was all downhill. An entire family on a motorcycle overtook me from behind and hovered next to me for a few seconds. “Your speed is twenty-nine,” the father of the family said, looking at his speedometer. He gave me a thumbs-up and they sped off.
 
At that clip, I was at Shey Monastery in about fifteen minutes. The view from the top, a rocky outcrop drenched in prayer flags overlooking the actual structure, offered a panorama of the surrounding valley. The streams and farms below looked lush, and there was a very sudden line between the green of the agricultural areas and the light brown of the desert that rose up to form the arid peaks all around.
 
The next monastery, Thiksey, was another fifteen minute ride away. One of the largest monasteries in Ladakh, Thiksey’s boxy buildings sprawled most of the way down the hill it occupied. On the way up, I met an Indian man with broad shoulders, aviators and an iron handshake. He was a lieutenant in the Indian army who was visiting the monastery with his wife. They peppered me with questions on the way up, every one of which started with my name—“Matthew what actors do you know?” (before listing Arnold Schwarzneggar and Sylvester Stallone), “Matthew what does your father do?”, and the most inevitable of all: “Matthew are you married?”
 
I found out a little bit about them, too, through their very heavy accents. They were from Bihar in the east, but had moved up to Leh six months before when the lieutenant was transferred there. He had been in the army for a decade already. He had Sundays off, but the other days was confined to the barracks (which, from what I gather, led to a lot of hopping over the fence), and a month of leave in December. They were incredibly friendly, and so pleased to meet me that I was a little embarrassed.
 
I don’t know if we took the conventional route up to the monastery, but before long we were clambering up the face of the mountain on all fours, and the lieutenant was pulling me and his wife up as if we were small children. At last we reached the center of the monastery, most of the way up the mountain. There were loudspeakers attached to the outside of the large building, emitting a droning voice. We removed our shoes and stepped over the threshold. Inside were about fifty monks, aged six to eighty, siting on the floor around a senior monk who was seated at a podium and reading from a religious text in a monotonous, sing-song drone.
 
We padded quietly around the perimeter of the room to the far side, where we stepped into a narrow gallery containing statues of the Buddha in several incarnations. I assumed that the lieutenant and his wife were Buddhist, based on their reverent attitudes toward everything in the monastery, but they told me they were Hindu. It may have just been a sign of mutual respect between two religions with a long and interconnected history; moreover, the couple’s home in Bihar is very close to Bodygal, Buddhism’s birthplace.
 
The roof of the monastery had some pretty fantastic and windswept views of the surrounding terrain. We climbed down and parted ways in the parking lot below, after an unlikely-to-be-followed promise that I would visit them in Bihar.
 
The ride back to Leh, of course, was almost entirely uphill. The last seven or eight kilometers shredded my quads, and I spent the last leg wheeling my bike alongside me as gasoline trucks lumbered past, kicking up dust.
 
Back in the Main Bazaar, I stopped at the scene of a large crowd and tied my bike to a lamppost. A group of street performers were in the middle of a show, two men and four boys. The performance was a mixed bag—four of them squeezed themselves into a small metal ring, which I don’t think proves much except that they were all skinny an underfed. At the end, though, one of the boys leapt through a ring of fire four feet off the ground, and then through another hoop that had knives pointing in from the frame towards the center.
 
Ten feet farther on, there was another knot of locals, and pressing in I saw the Czech girl with dreadlocks sitting on the sidewalk strumming a guitar. There was a dreadlocked guy manning a drum next to her. I was too exhausted to linger—just sitting up elevated my heart rate—so I went to rescue my tipped-over bike from two nosy donkeys and staggered back to Changspa.

There was one more adventure I really wanted to have in Ladakh before I set sail from the Himalayas. The following morning I returned to the bike shop to pick up a bicycle for the famous descent from Khardung La.
 
Two hours north of Leh at the head of the Nubra Valley, Khardung La is claimed by all local tourist organizations to be the highest motorable pass in the world. A little bit of research plays spoilsport on this claim, and it turns out that there are at least three or four higher, all quite nearby. But at 17,582 feet, Khardung La is plenty high. Supposedly, at that height, a typical combustion engine will have lost about 50% of its power at sea level. And a sub-18,000 foot altitude is still small fry as far as the Himalayas are concerned: According to one count, the world’s 188 highest peaks are all in the Himalaya and surrounding ranges, all of them over 22,500 feet.
 
Anyway, taking a jeep up to the top of Khardung La and then biking down again is one of Ladakh’s most renowned tourist activities. It was mainstream, but I didn’t want to miss it.
I had briefly considered biking to the top myself before coming down. It sounded very sporty and admirable, but then a more realistic part of my brain clicked on and I realized how painful climbing from 12,000 to 18,000 feet on a bicycle would be. In all likelihood it would be impossible for me in my current mediocre shape, and I would have to flag down a sympathetic passing vehicle.
 
So I set out in the jeep instead, bikes strapped to the roof, alongside Israelis, Japanese and one Argentinean. At the top, everyone had their requisite picture with the sign advertising the faux “highest motorable pass” claim. It was pretty chilly, and clogged with tourists. But it was by far the highest that I’ve been in my life, and unless I venture into Nepal it will stay that way for the foreseeable future.
 
Finished milling around, we mounted our bikes and strapped on our helmets. I felt like we should be strapping on goggles too—there was a brisk wind carrying the omnipresent Ladakhi dust. The first half of the ride was grit-your-teeth bumpy. The road was just a stretch of gravel scattered with soccer ball sized rocks and potholes, so there was plenty of time to take in the impressive view as we braked our way down. There were two spills and a punctured tire in our party. I spent much of this first half riding with a young Japanese guy from my jeep. He was there with his auntie, but she went flying down the mountain at breakneck speeds and quickly left the rest of us in the dust.
 
After we passed a police checkpoint, the road abruptly transitioned from gravel to asphalt and the ride became blissfully smooth. I lowered my chin to an inch from the handlebars and zipped down into the valley, passing slow-moving trucks and other cyclists.  Even at this speed, it was a full hour before I arrived at the northern outskirts of the city.
 
The Japanese guy and I managed to get tremendously lost on our way back to Changspa, and after a long detour wandering through four-foot wide alleyways and those tinkling streams (found ‘em), we arrived at a decent restaurant. Over a plate of something pretending to be pad thai I heard my Japanese companion’s life story. He was a chronic traveler who had left home in Hiroshima when he was about my age and had lived on nearly every continent since then. Recently he had been spending his autumns in California cutting marijuana to finance his degree in social work. He had a really good sarcastic sense of humor that struck me as being quite un-Japanese: I particularly liked his claim that he couldn’t go to the bathroom in an Asian restaurant without being mistaken for a waiter along the way. And, of course, he was vegetarian.
 
Having completed the descent from Khardung La, I decided it was time to leave Leh for the gentler hills south in Mansli. The conventional way to do this was to reserve a space on an 11-seat minibus that departed at 1 am and drove straight through into the following evening. But I wanted to see the view, and the minibus cost a whopping 2200 rupees. At this point, I should probably mention that 60 rupees is equivalent to about one dollar. So 2200 R was about $37, or a full week’s rent at a guesthouse with a couple meals thrown in.
 
I decided I could do better than that, so I trekked out to the bus stand and went through the demoralizing process of trying to book a local bus by myself. As is not uncommon, the ticket window was either closed or nonexistent, so I was left to wander the two-acre jumble of unmarked vehicles. The only way to track down the right bus in these situations is to ask someone every thirty feet or so; after quite a bit of experience, I can say that about two out of every three people will at least point vaguely. But unfortunately that just didn't suffice this time around, and I failed completely to locate the Manali bus.
 
Walking back to Changspa in defeat, I ran into the Czech girls. By some happy stroke of luck, they were talking with a travel agent friend of theirs who offered to accompany me to the bus stand. After only a few minutes of searching (even locals have to grope their way around these situations sometimes), he helped me book a 600 rupee seat for 4 am the next morning. And as if he weren’t already saintly enough, he picked me up at 3:30 am and deposited me at the bus for my final epic mountain drive.
