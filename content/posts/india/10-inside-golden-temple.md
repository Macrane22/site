Amritsar was a return to the heat and grit that I had last seen three weeks before in Delhi. The terrain was flat, the rooftop cafes were no more, and the loud everything-at-once clamor of Indian streets was back.
 
I didn’t get to Amritsar the way I planned: At the bus stand in Manali, I was seized by a last-minute impulse and bought a ticket to Shimla, another hill station to the south. I’d heard stories of the famous monkey temple there and wanted to make a stop before Amritsar.
 
The bus ride to Shimla was an ordeal, mainly because my seatmate was a middle-aged guy who wouldn’t even entertain the prospect of five seconds of silence passing between us. He was wearing the same Himachali cloth cap and suit that my seatmate on the Leh-Manali highway had worn, the only passenger on the bus in this outfit. He also had the same rancidly sweet liquor on his breath. His name, from his introduction, was something like Sundersinkjohn Rigdaveesi. He didn’t buy into the concept of distilling it down into one or two syllables.
 
SR thought he could speak English. He really did, and over the next hour and a half I looked for something intelligible in his slurring. It was like seeing genitalia and butterflies in ink splotches, and I’m not sure if any of it was actually there. At various points, I thought he was trying to sell me precious metals, invite me to his house for dinner, or tell the bus driver to stop at a roadside stall.
 
By the time we pulled into Shimla, somewhere between the middle of the night and the morning, SR was gone and I was unconscious. Although Shimla is perched on a spiny ridge with panoramic views on both sides, there was no sign of it that night: Split-pea soup fog, rain and darkness obscured everything. After an excursion with a hopeful tout who showed me an overpriced room and an indecisive few minutes at the old bus stand, where a hundred people were huddled around a small TV showing a Bollywood Zorro, I threw the idea of Shimla out the window. It was time to go.
 
Continuing my streak of bad luck, I missed the Shimla-Amritsar bus by minutes. I hopped on one to Chandigarh instead, the closest I could get. It was a great example of just how anticlimactic travel can sometimes be.
 
With my arrival in Chandigarh, I had changed states from Himachal to Punjab, the homeland of the Sikhs. Chandigarh has a claim to fame as India’s first modern planned city: Swiss architect Le Corbusier laid it out in the fifties. Indeed, navigating its wide avenues and rotaries was like driving through a crop circle. I never quite felt that I was in a city.
 
With one more bus through the scenic Punjabi countryside, I was in Amritsar. The sun was out and the city was alive, and I was glad to be at a destination at all.

For the intents and purposes of the casual traveler, Amritsar is the Golden Temple in the same way that Agra is the Taj Mahal, a world-class site slapped in the middle of an anonymous city.
 
Fast facts: The Golden Temple is the largest gurdwara, or Sikh temple, in the world, the spiritual capital of Sikhism, destination for millions of pilgrims and more than a few tourists.
Inhabiting the Golden Temple involved stepping into a world of routine. Standing in front of the gates to the temple complex that first day, dripping in the heat, I was exposed to some of the sundry ones: Shoes had to be removed and turned into a holding station in return for a little reclaim token, and you had to make at least a half-hearted show of cleaning your feet in a tiny moat. Your head had to be covered within the complex. I picked up an orange bandana that became toxically sweaty and filthy over the next two days, but for that period it was as integral to my outfit as my shorts.
 
I entered into the temple complex and did my first circuit on the marble walkway. Flanked by white marble buildings, rectangular walkway wraps around a large pool of water. In the middle of the pool, connected to one side of the walkway, is the temple itself, an intricate and softly shiny building of gold.
 
Inside the temple was a shrine, around which men sat playing drums and harmonium while others sang out of hymnals. A Sikh Dumbledore sat on a plinth reading from a holy book the size of a very large tombstone—the largest I’ve ever seen—and mouthing to himself quietly. Someone has to be reading from this copy at all times of day. I suppose they must work in shifts.
Really there was nothing to do except walk around the pool again and again, watching the pilgrims. This was my first glimpse of pilgrims up-close. They sat and lay around the complex, generally doing nothing and saying nothing. In the States we have people who lie in sleeping bags outside movie theaters waiting for the next Star Wars. But I’m certainly not accustomed to seeing droves of people camped out at a given place just to be at that place. They slept curled up in their clothes on the open marble, in rows and clusters, whole families and solo travelers, with no personal effects in sight. Sometimes it resembled the scene of a bloodless massacre.
 
There was a kind of mass peacefulness that I’d only expect to find at an important religious site.
Things weren’t always so serene in the foreigners’ dormitory, where we non-Indians received free lodging inside the temple complex. It wasn’t surprising—twenty travelers of different nationalities and dispositions were cooped together, left to jockey for beds and shower time in the stickiness. At any given time, at least a few of the cots were occupied by unconscious foreigners who had wilted in the heat. This was all overlooked by the friendly Amrit, our RA of sorts, whose usefulness was limited because he spoke little English.
 
In here I met Gozde, a Turkish girl who was in the second half of her northern India circuit. She was an amiable companion and a rigorously motivated sightseer. She was also quite invested in warning me about the evils of sugar and its effects on body chemistry. I took her for a few years older than me, but a couple days later I found out that she was born in 1980. Maybe her anti-sugar stance had more to it than I gave her credit for.
 
When we weren’t making a circuit around the temple, we were eating in the dining hall.
 
 
The Golden Temple dining hall was an incredibly mechanical and efficient operation: Walking through the entryway, you were handed a plate, bowl and spoon in quick succession, without having to slow your pace. A flight of stairs led up to one of the airy and well-windowed dining halls. In these, the pilgrims and other visitors sat cross-legged on the floor in long rows stretching from wall to wall.
 
Volunteers trundled up and down the rows, one with a water spigot on wheels; others splashed the main course onto your plate out of large metal buckets. I ate four meals there. They invariably consisted of two kinds of lentils and a sweet dish that varied between butternut squash and coconut rice pudding. There was sometimes rice and always chapatti, the simplest and most universal of Indian breads.
 
There were more rituals here: To ask for chapatti, you cupped your hands in front of you and the server dropped the bread into them. Another volunteer, usually a little boy, walked in front of the rows of eaters spilling water out of a kettle—at first I thought he was just really clumsy—and a second boy followed behind at a run, pushing a mop.
 
Eating was a business, or perhaps some kind of holy act. There was little talking and no lingering, but the whole experience was almost perfectly communal. And, in keeping with the traditions of Sikh gurdwaras, all of the food was free. The Golden Temple must dispense thousands of free meals a day. I’d like to see its numbers compared with the most effective and efficient charities in the West.
 
Once finished eating, you stood up with your plate, walked out, dropped your spoon in a box, handed off the dishes, and made an inevitable stop at the chai station.
 
The chai station was the place to socialize, whether or not you wanted to—unlike in the dining hall, the chai drinkers were squished together in a tight pack and willing to linger. I stood out even more inside the Temple than I did in the rest of India, and I had many friendly half-conversations here. I also met Gurwinder, a young Sikh who spoke good English and taught me most of the pittance I know about Sikhism and Punjabi culture.
 
There were a few things about Gurwinder that I gather were quintessentially Sikh: The turban and boyish facial hair, of course, but also the knife he carried on a strap around his shoulder. All Sikhs carry knives. Strolling around the temple, many wore them fully visible outside their tunics. Others could be seen poking out from underneath.
 
Gurwinder was also exceptionally and almost unconditionally friendly. Speaking from a small sample size, I found that all of the Punjabis I met were outgoingly friendly and delighted to go out of their way to help, regardless of your sometimes sincere protests.
 
Along with their knives, Sikhs also wear a metal bangle on their wrist. Gozde had met another Sikh in the temple named Vismeet, who took it upon himself to see to ensure that our next leg of travel was smoothly booked. We met Vismeet’s family our second night there, his silent wife and two wiggly little daughters. I noticed that even the little girls had miniature bangles on. Their purpose, or at least one of them, became clear when Vismeet pulled out his iPhone and flipped through pictures of several men with bruised and bloodied faces. It turned out that they were thieves he had caught on the temple premises. All of them had been on the receiving end of Vismeet’s metal bangle.
 
This militant streak of justice seems to be an integral part of Punjabi culture. While I was on one of my circuits, a group of men apprehended a drunk in the courtyard outside our dorm and beat him. I found out about it later from one of my dorm-mates.
 
This militancy goes way back: Sikhism, a bit like Buddhism long before it, was a monotheistic reaction to the austerity and inequality of conservative Hinduism, and also to Islam. The Sikhs have faced near extermination several times. They were among the most staunchly opposed to British rule of anyone in India, and were the targets of a large-scale massacre by British troops in 1919. In a square near the Golden Temple I passed a statue of Udham Singh, the Sikh who assassinated the British governor of Punjab during the massacre 21 years after the fact.
I picked up a couple of Sikhism pamphlets at the Temple gate in the hope of educating myself.
 
But they were all riddled with mysterious references and grammatical errors just subtle enough to make reading difficult. One of them, a rebuttal to anti-Sikh editorials published in one of India’s leading newspapers, was full of criticism of both Hindus and Muslims.
