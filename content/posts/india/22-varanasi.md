I leaned out of the side door on my train to Varanasi, wind blowing in my face, and watched the blank spaces on the map chug by. The sun was setting over a landscape of crags, strewn boulders and villages connected to the outside world by nothing but power lines. Behind and in front of me, from one vanishing point to the other, men's heads poked out of other compartment doorways, doing exactly what I was doing. I finally understood the romanticization of train travel, although actual romance was thin on the ground. I had no one to enjoy the view with except a one-legged man slumped next to the bathrooms with his crutches. Once or twice, a passenger squeezed past him to go to the bathroom and shouted at him for obstructing their way.
 
Arrival in Varanasi the next morning offered a sharp contrast to the tranquility of the train journey. I stepped out of the station into bright sunlight and the arms of a dozen tuuk-tuuk drivers. My tuuk-tuuk hit a fierce traffic jam on the way into the city, the kind in which traffic is stalled long enough for the drivers to get out of their vehicles and yell at each other.
 
I had arranged reached to meet my friends Amelia and Andriana at our guesthouse, but when I arrived I discovered that they were out, I set off to explore on my own. This was Varanasi's Old Quarter, a cobweb of tightly wound streets too narrow in most places for vehicles to pass through. The Old Quarter crowded up against the banks of the Ganges, while the new city sprawled outward in the opposite direction.
 
In a few turns, I found myself once again overlooking the Ganges River. It was much wider here than at Orchha: the opposite bank was just a distant slick of mud. I was standing at the top of set of steep stone steps that led down to the water, where boats bobbed at their docking points. The steps were called a ghat, and there were more than a dozen spread along Varanasi's Ganges coastline. Some ghats were connected by concrete and stone, but others were separated by muddy stretches of riverside.
 
The Ganges, Mother Ganga to Hindus,  is a flood-prone river. Just a few weeks before my visit, the water level reached my current position at the top of the ghat. I had spoken with travelers who couldn't take a boat out onto the river because the water was far too high. Even now, the Ganges was swollen from monsoon rains: The ghat steps vanished into the river and reached their terminus well below the depths.
 
I walked absent-mindedly from ghat to ghat, ignoring the people I encountered along the way who warned me against walking through the mucky stretches.
 
Near Hanuman ghat, the southern terminus of Varanasi's riverside, the riverside deteriorated into pure mud. Much of it looked dry, and I could see trails of footprints weaving through it, evidence of prior victorious crossings. I began to pick my way through the cesspool, but no: One of my feet sank through up to my shin, into the squelchiest mud I've ever felt. I tried to liberate it, but the mud suctioned to my shoe like superglue, and only my sock and foot emerged. I reached down to my elbow and wrenched out my shoe, to the amusement of those watching from around the ghat. One of them, the chuckling man closest to me, escorted me to the waterside, where I washed off the worst of the mud, no doubt coating myself with toxic chemicals in the process.
 
Things improved after that. I met Amelia and Andriana at the guesthouse, and we set off away from the river towards Varanasi's temples.
 
We were on the lookout for sadhus, Hinduism's wandering ascetics. Sadhus share certain similarities with the Buddhist monks of other parts of Asia: They are much respected by the general religious population, rely on alms for subsistence, and are spotted not infrequently on the streets. They also generally wear orange or saffron robes.
 
But sadhus have a much wilder appearance: They often have thickly braided hair that hasn't been cut in years. Some carry tridents, others cloth-wrapped poles that are forbidden from touching the ground; some smear their faces with ash and some, I have heard, carry human skulls under their arms. And their eyes, the few times I have seen them up close, are the eyes of men who have spent years living alone in the mountains devoid of earthly possessions. Which many of them have. Other-worldly as they are, they have gained some recognition through the likes of Discovery Channel documentaries.
 
Because Varanasi and the Varanasi stretch of Ganges are among Hinduism's holiest sites, we did indeed spot sadhus all over the place:  perched monkey-like on the ghats, standing along Varanasi's shopping boulevards, walking with their staffs through the backstreets.
 
Others of Varanasi's sights were more mundane. We walked into an ashram, but saw nothing except a fish pond and an exhibit dedicated to the resident guru. We did rounds at several temples, including one painted entirely bright red. At this one, as at the others, we were ambushed by a custodian who dotted our foreheads with a smudge of orange powder and then solicited a donation.
 
Later, we visited Varanasi's temple to the monkey deity Hanuman. I was reminded of my own encounter with vicious primates in Shimla's Hanuman temple. This one required that we deposit our phones in lockers at the entrance, a safeguard against literal monkey mischief. Almost immediately, we ran into an Australian woman who had four deep red tooth  marks impressed into her back. She apparently was the victim of a random act of aggression. Overhead, monkeys scurried along branches, posturing and squawking at each other in an ear-splitting racket. Feeling extremely vulnerable, we retreated out of the leafy enclosure back into the city.
 
That night, there was a ceremony along the water at Hanuman ghat.  We sat on the ghat steps among mostly Indian spectators and watched for half an hour as a row of white-robed ceremonial priests twirled torches and rang bells. Their display was solemn enough to be sacred, but arcane enough to ensure that nobody in the audience actually had any idea what they were doing. At the ceremony's end, we each took a lotus flower and laid it on the river's surface.  I don't know exactly what this ceremony was called, but it happens nightly was described to us as 'pooja,' which merely means 'prayer.'
 
I suspect that the pooja is a hotbed of eccentrics and scam artists targeting Varanasi's foreign visitors. Andriana got into a conversation with a scholarly, bespectacled man in white robes who was sitting next to her, who called himself Baba.
 
By the ceremony's end, Baba had a 500 rupee note to buy a train ticket to the Himalayas, where he planned to attain enlightenment, and Andriana was reciting a mantra that he promised would grant her 1,000 gold coins and 1,000 cattle, provided that she repeated it a proper number of times, in proper proximity to the Ganges.
 
For the remainder of our stay in Varanasi, Baba called Andriana's cell phone twice a day, over a line thick with static, told her to recite her mantra, murmured an approving "ok," and abruptly hung up. At the very least, her $8 provided us her money's worth of entertainment.
 
I have my doubts that Baba was as holy as he presented himself, but I'm not sure--Varanasi was full of little pockets of surrealism, brief moments and encounters like this that were far removed from our 21st century culture.

The morning after the pooja, I went for my first boat ride on the Ganges. Amelia and Andriana were on a boat the morning I arrived. They told me that they had seen a dead pregnant woman floating down the river. Being morbidly curious, I decided I couldn't miss this.
 
I had expected a crush of boat pilots to descend on me when I reached the river, but the ghat by our guesthouse was quiet. I accepted the offer of the first man who approached me, who introduced himself as Godi Boatman.
 
Godi Boatman was wearing a green t-shirt that stretched with his chest muscles as he rowed us out onto the river. Varanasi at dawn was both placid and lively. As we moved upstream, we flowed into the pulsing ceremonial heart of the Ganges riverside. Worshipers and bathers stood along the banks or swam in the river, reciting prayers, bathing and washing clothes. Some had ash smeared in patterns over their shoulders and foreheads. Others dunked their heads in and out of the water or meditated on the ghat steps.
 
One thing I remember quite well is the silence. There were many people along the ghats, but from my vantage point on the boat they all appeared quiet, attending to their own business. Apart from the fact that a few of the people along the water locked eyes with me, I felt as though a piece of film were sliding past me, footage of some bygone age or alternate universe.
 
The opposite bank of the river was flat and barren, as though the Ganges had halted the urban sprawl and dragged it down to its silty bottom.
 
I didn't see any bodies. So the next morning, Andriana and I cut through the quiet pre-dawn alleyways down to the ghat. We found Godi Boatman in the same spot he had been yesterday, wearing the same green t-shirt. In light of the pregnant woman, Amelia had refused to go out again.
 
Godi rowed us out for another tour, past the scenes of ritual and morning bathing at the ghats. Once again I was struck by a sense of surprising tranquility, besides the occasional boatload of Asian tourists clad in bright orange life jackets.
 
As the sun came up behind a thick glaze of fog, Godi rowed us back towards our starting point. The rhythm of the boat had knocked Andriana out, and I was sleepy.  Suddenly, Andriana sat bolt upright and pointed to our left. An off-white object was floating towards us. I took it for the remains of a cow, definitely a cow, maybe a goat... As we approached, I saw one arm outstretched behind the head, a blackly gaping chest cavity, and finally a face that was more human than skeleton. We goggled at the corpse as it floated past. Godi Boatman saw our curiosity and laughed. He glanced at the form in the water. "Is body of holy man," he said.
 
Most Hindus are cremated. However, pregnant women, sadhus, lepers, animals, young children and people who die by snakebite are ineligible to be burned, for reasons I do not fully understand. Thus, their corpses are often deposited in the Ganges, perhaps weighted down by stones but perhaps not, where they periodically pop up to horrify and delight tourists out on their morning boat ride.
 
To many people, Varanasi is a prime place to witness the circle of life: Life is in the devotion of the worshipers on the waterfront and the routine of people who bathe and wash clothes in the river. But death is the more dramatic and absorbing half of the picture. It is in the corpses floating downstream, and in the ash that blows off the cremation pyres into the river that people drink and swim in.
 
The next day, we took a look at the cremation ghats.
 
Our excursion began on Varanasi's shopping streets, with shop after shop displaying gaudily colored dresses and saris, and more elicit salespeople pushing recreational drugs. We followed one of the streets straight down to the river and began picking our way along the ghats toward the cremations. I had amassed some fairly unpleasant facial hair by this point, and everywhere I looked there seemed to be a streetside barber waving a straight razor at me and motioning emphatically at my face.
 
The cremation fires were sending plumes of smoke up from the ghat in front of us. We paused hesitantly at a small flight of steps that led up to the pyres, watching the strangely industrious scene. A bystander leaning on the railing warned us to take no photos and give no money to any guides. These were warnings we had heard repeatedly: These pyres were absolutely sacred to Hindus, and they expected foreigners to exercise proper respect.
 
We climbed up to the ghat, skirting around one of the pyres. Almost immediately, we were approached by one of the guides we had been warned to avoid: A grey-bearded man with a cloth wrapped around his head like a wimple. He told us that we would have a better view from the top of the building overlooking the ghat. And indeed, we did: the covered balcony he took us to had a clear view over the scene. We watched below as the bodies, wrapped in colored cloth, smoldered slowly on their plinths of wood and ash. These weren't massive bonfires:  each body took hours to burn all the way through.
 
There were several pyres on the ghat, and around each a group of attendants milled around each and poked at the flames. More wrapped bodies lay on the ground, awaiting their turn. The guide stood at my shoulder as I leaned on the railing. He told me that only wealthy families could afford to burn their dead here; For Hindus, this is the holiest of send-offs. and the family must buy the wood required to keep the fires alight, Although a poorer family could use cheaper wood, the cost still came to thousands of rupees.
 
The attendants poking at the flames were Untouchables, whose station guaranteed that they would never have the privilege of being cremated here.
 
The breast bones of women and the pelvis bones of men were often not burned because they were too large, particularly if the family could not afford the quantity of wood required to keep the pyre alight for hours. Thus, when the fire had burned to smolders, the Untouchables threw the remaining bones into the water for dogs to scrounge. I could see mangy dogs prowling along the waterline, waiting.
 
Beyond the dogs, waist-deep in the murk of the Ganges, men naked except for loincloths were shaking silt out of large shallow pans. More Untouchables. The guide told me that they were searching for gold.
 
He rattled off a tale of a Hindu deity who left gold behind in the river after touching down briefly on Earth for some divine adventure or another. Thinking back on those Untouchables, I wonder if they have ever found a single nugget of gold in those waters. Not incidentally, gold in the Ganges and other Indian rivers has long been the stuff of legend, even in the West. The 4th-century ecclesiastical figure St. Ambrose mentions a river of "pure gold, brilliant rubies and topaz stones," a river called the Phison by Hebrews "but named Ganges by the Greeks."
 
What the Untouchables and hundreds of millions of others who live along the Ganges are likely to encounter is disease. The levels of disease-causing bacteria in the river is thousands of times above the safe standard. Some travelers like to posit that the accumulation of corpses, waste and ash has skewed the Ganges' chemistry to the point that it's no longer water at all. If this is true of the Ganges, then it's true of the Ohio and many of our own rivers also. But I do wonder what a diving expedition would find if they were to trawl that riverbed.
 
The wind was blowing the smoke from below into my eyes and mouth. Behind me, Amelia was sitting by the staircase with watering eyes. A man ambled up to her, looked her up and down, said, "No woman, no cry!" with a hearty chuckle, and walked off.
 
We exchanged a nod and decided to leave. As we turned around, the guide called after us from the railing, inciting us for a donation for Mother Theresa's foundation. There were two elderly women seated on the floor at the head of the staircase. They leered at us and extended their hands, nodding expectantly. Taking to heart the warning not to hand over money to these people, we walked on.
 
"This is very bad for karma," the guide said shrilly, a frenetic coldness in his voice that probably indicated anger.
 
He pursued us down the stairs, simultaneously bemoaning our lack of generosity and threatening us with it.
 
With a last angry warning about the karmic hole we were digging ourselves, the guide fell  behind us as we climbed from the ghats back into Varanasi's center.

When we weren't poking along the ghats, we were usually lazing on our guesthouse rooftop. Rooftops were a fixture of my Indian trip. European cities are full of cafes with  outdoor patio seating, and American streets are lined with sterile indoor spaces. When westerners need refuge from the grit of the Indian streets, they retreat to the rooftops, where they can look down on the action, and enjoy a butter masala and banana crepe on the side.
 
This particular roof played host to an amiable group of travelers. Besides Amelia, Andriana and I, there were three Spaniards, a Frenchman, two Jewish Israelis, one Arab Israeli, a Mexican and an Uruguayan woman in her sixties. Lala, the guesthouse's friendly and paunchy owner himself, often lounged up there with his sons.
 
One day, Lala offered to take Amelia, Andriana and me to see his guru for an astrological consultation. He wasn't the first guesthouse owner I had met who was eager to for his guests to meet his master (as gurus are usually called): The manager of my hostel in Jaipur had carted along several of his Japanese guests to his master's ashram, and I would have gone but for lack of space.
 
I was heartily skeptical of the authority of Lala's guru, but after some wavering I decided to tag along to meet him anyway. Amelia, Andriana and I piled into the back of a tuuk-tuuk, with Lala and the driver in front, and clattered our way through Varanasi's sidestreets into a residential district.
 
Lala's master lived on an upper floor of a small building that overlooked a cramped courtyard. We were ushered into his small quarters and sat tentatively on the floor. Lala sat against the wall across from us to watch the proceedings impassively. Either the power was out or there were no electric lights at all. The day outside was overcast, so the dim lighting lent the space a musty and old-fashioned air.
 
The guru called himself Bablu. He was a small man who looked more like Gandhi than Ben Kingsley ever could. His egg-like head had a fringe of white hair, he wore white robes and had a friendly gleam in one of his eyes behind wiry round glasses. The only discernible distinction between Gandhi and Bablu was that Bablu's other eye was milky and blind.
 
He smiled at us. "Why have you come here, my dears?"
 
Tentatively, Andriana let on that we had come for his divination services.
 
He nodded agreeably and pulled out a folder of documents and laid them on the ground. I saw handwritten letters, and documents full of scribbled mathematical sums, angle measurements and other vestiges of computational astrology.
 
Bablu explained his services. He offered three astrological packages, ranging from a cursory palm reading to an en suite list of specific predictions, lucky numbers and planets. For the latter, he needed our name, address and parents' names in order to conduct the proper numerological methods.
 
Amelia and Andriana signed up for mid-range packages. I was quickly backpedaling on my belief that I wanted anything at all. I asked if he could explain the astrological equations on his documents to me.
 
Undoubtedly accustomed to skepticism, he was irritated: "That is too much explaining, my dear. You will not understand."
 
But he showed me one of his laudatory letters. It was addressed to him from a European woman who was now in prison: "You warned me to beware of my enemies, Bablu, and now I understand what you meant..."
 
In the end, a little stiffly, I signed up for a palm reading for the hell of it. There was no sense in being afraid of something I didn't believe in, after all, and I decided that I was willing to hand out $18 for the experience. We arranged for Bablu to meet each of us in turn at the guesthouse the next day.
 
We sat on the guesthouse rooftop under a sagging canopy inadequate at dispelling the driving rain, and waited for him to call on us one by one.
 
When my turn came, I found Bablu sitting on the bed of an empty room on the second floor.  He beamed at me, and after a bit of small-talk I extended one of my hands, palm up.
 
"Why are you doing this to your hand, my dear?" I had forgotten--in Orchha, one of the women in my homestay family had given me henna tattoos on both of my palms. The novelty of the patterns had worn off in a day--the best thing that could be said was that my hands had smelled like nutmeg for a few days. I pulled out my flashlight and shone it on my palm while Bablu squinted at it.
 
In the end, I was disappointed, relieved and irritated all at once. Bablu's statements were vague enough to be essentially meaningless, yet relatable enough to be slightly off-putting.  He seemed to be aware of past traumas about which I knew nothing (like the serious illness that afflicted me in my early childhood). To be honest, the fact that a stranger was claiming intimate knowledge of my life was richly annoying.
 
Sitting on the rooftop comparing notes with Amelia and Andriana, both of whom were quite impressed with him, I had to admit that Bablu was either a shrewd judge of character or an honest practitioner of an ancient art in which people fill open-ended statements with their own beliefs. Perhaps both.  He claimed that he had learned astrology from his father, who had learned from his father before him, and so on. But Bablu had no son, because he had no wife, because he was ugly. That made me a little sad, and I relaxed any aggravation I had with myself about giving up the equivalent of four nights' rent.

Amelia and Andriana left the next morning for Nepal. Left to me own devices, I decided to take a final stroll along the Ganges. I walked from ghat to ghat headed south along the river, just as I did that first day. Near Hanuman ghat, I once again encountered a stretch of mud, perhaps the same one that had sucked me in the first time. I was wiser now, though. I hopped and weaved skillfully around the dangerous patches, gauging the wetness of each next step, and promptly sank in up to my kneecaps.
 
The mud was like quicksand: I could barely move. If I were out in the middle of nowhere, this would have been a serious dilemma. I had nothing stable to hold onto to hoist myself out, so I had to bathe in my humiliation while the nearest bystander carefully positioned himself and wrenched me out by the armpits. A knot of Scandinavian-looking tourists applauded from the safety of the ghat in front of me.
 
I squelched to a bathhouse and hosed myself off. I watched the Ganges mud run into the drain, and I emerged twenty minutes later still partially coated.  Varanasi had repeatedly humbled me, but looking back on it, I think that means I did it right.
