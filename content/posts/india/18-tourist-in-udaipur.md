India was an experience as much as a destination:  Walking down the street was an event, and the daily life that I glimpsed along the way was an attraction. In fact, I didn't actually do much in India. I rarely had an itinerary. The (often worthwhile) guidebook fodder of historical sites and visitor-tailored activities were rarely the highlights of my trip.
 
This isn't really condescension towards those whose style of travel was more organized and deliberate than mine; most people, after all, had a time constraint.  I can attest firsthand to the pinch of irritation when fellow travelers gaped at me for only spending two days in such-and-such a place (it was almost always Israelis, talking about Manali and Kasol).
 
Rather, I think that the best parts of travel are often the unexpected ones, and the more control I tried to exert over my trip, the more anemic it became.
 
But in Udaipur, more than anywhere else in India, the creature comforts were a notch higher than I was used to, and I purposefully structured my days around activities. So I spent less time wandering normal, but I did quite a bit.

After yoga class one morning, Mariano, Fin, Martin and I hired a rickshaw into the green and lake-filled countryside west of Udaipur. Our destination was a local shelter that tended to sick and wounded animals, casualties inherent in being a quadraped in a developing country.
 
The shelter was a true outpost of Western sensibilities; it was founded by an American family. The man who gave us a tour told us that while they received a two or three dozen foreign visitors a month, Indian visitors were very rare, perhaps ten percent of the total. Most westerners, like us, were probably guided to the shelter by Lonely Planet or another arm of the traveler grapevine, but I found it interesting that the shelter relied on western founders, visitors and presumably western money, and that India never came into the equation at all.
 
Mariano had told me in Jaisalmer how he had seen a man prowling through the streets, beating dogs over the head with a metal bucket. Purely anecdotal though this is, I had noticed little love lost between animals and people thus far.
 
The shelter was divided into cloisters based on the particular infirmity of the resident critters. In one section, three-legged dogs hopped and hobbled; in another, dogs with crippled back limbs pulled themselves along, like half-canine half-sled hybrids. Their blind brethren lazed in another nearby enclave. A couple of loafish pigs soaked in muddy pits while goats with broken ankles chewed around them. There was one ill-tempered blind monkey and two tortoises with broken shells.
 
The pitiable sight of all this reduced Mariano and Fin to puddles. Not an animal lover, I paid my respects politely, while Martin gave the animals one uninterested glance and sat down at a picnic table for the remainder of our visit.
 
Most disturbing and interesting of the inmates were the emaciated cows spending their last days shivering under blankets, their stomachs (all four of them?) chock full of plastic.
 
There are more cows than dogs on Indian streets; I gaped at them when I first arrived, but within a week they were as natural a part of the traffic jam as the tuuk-tuuks and motorcycles were. Supposedly most of these cows have owners; at least that's what I've heard. Yet walking through the streets at night, it's hard not to trip over them as they recline all over the place. If I had a rupee for every time I'd seen a cow munching through piles of garbage on the side of the road, I'd be able to stay in the Taj Palace Hotel.

The next day, Martin, Mariano and I signed up for an evening cooking class with the well-known Shashi, whom a fellow traveler had recommended earlier in my Rajasthan tour.
 
Incidentally, I've noticed that cooking classes are a common fixture in cities across Asia that are considered to be more refined and cultured than their country's average. Lonely Planet loves them, and Udaipur fit the bill for India.
 
Shashi arranged transport from out hostel to her house, a three-minute tuuk-tuuk journey into a leafy and quiet cul-de-sac. Her house was the first private Indian residence I'd stepped into since Himachal and Kashmir, and the first inhabited by a brown-skinned Hindu person who spoke Hindi, the archetypal Indian I had always imagined before I became attuned to the country's incredible diversity.
 
Martin, Mariano and I stood in a prosperous-looking atrium, with marble floors and a polished wooden dining table.  White noise dribbled from a TV in a side room.
 
Shashi emerged from the kitchen, a middle-aged woman in silk and bangles, and sat us down at the dining room table with a business-like manner. She launched into the story of how she came to hold cooking classes with practiced precision, looking each of us in the eye in turn.
 
It began with Shashi, a member of the Brahmin caste, Hinduism's highest social echelon, mourning the death of her husband.  The mourning period required of Brahmin widows is austere; in the caste system, the high and the lowly are both shackled by ritual and custom, particularly women: as an obedient widow, she was house-bound for one year. For at least part of this time, she sat in a designated corner and received mourner-visitors from 5:30 in the morning until 5 in the evening.
 
When the mourning period ended, Shashi fell out of the frying pan into the fire, and into a financial black hole: As a Brahmin widow, she was not permitted to remarry, but she was also barred from taking up menial work to support herself and her son. Better to starve, perhaps, than to work at the construction sites alongside Untouchables. She ran a covert laundry service until the encouragement of her son and two European travelers led her to hesitantly launch her first cooking tutorial. Being a Hindu woman had proved to be a liability, but she had at least learned to cook.
 
A few years later, an American, German and Guatemalan spent five hours in that kitchen stirring, dicing and inhaling the pungent steam rising off the cooking pots while Shashi swept around us, grabbing our forearms and instructing in her brisk manner.
 
We watched parantha breads bubble up off the hot plate, made our own cheese naan and learned the buildings blocks of North Indian masalas, which is what most people think of as a standard Indian curry. Seven ingredients--seeds, oregano seeds, cumin seeds, tumeric, coriander powder, chili powder and garam masala, which is itself a mixture--form the building blocks of that archetypal Indian flavor. Everything, from Indian tea to India itself, is a masala in a sense, because the word means mixed.
 
After the steam settled, we sat down at the dining table and failed miserably to eat everything that we had cooked.

In Udaipur's "old quarter," often a code-name for the part of town where tourists congregate, every guesthouse and restaurant had erected a sign in large block letters:
 
A/C ROOMS
VEG & NON-VEG RESTAURANT
OCTOPUSSY
 
Octopussy is probably the only link between Udaipur and Western pop culture; although the city is never mentioned by name, most of the film's India portion takes place there. It was only fair to expect Udaipur to milk the bejeezus out of it.
 
Primarily because I hadn't watched a Bond movie in a long time, I wanted to see Octopussy on location. My own guesthouse claimed to show it every night, but the tiny screen was tucked in a small room furnished with only a double bed, and that wasn't really the theater experience I was hoping for.
 
In the end, half a dozen of us picked a restaurant across the footbridge. The movie was as good, of course.  Never mind that M hands James a ticket to Delhi, but Bond disembarks from a helicopter behind the Taj Mahal, then goes for a stroll along the ghats of Varanasi, 600 kilometers away, and then rolls into Udaipur.
 
And sure, Bond's India is a sanitized version of the real thing--where were the heaps of trash, the disorganized and fascinating clutter of beggars, street stalls and hangers-on, mangy dogs, cows, tailor shops with their salesmen loitering outside? Probably safely off camera, herded behind yellow tape and swept behind closed doors by the film crew.
 
Udaipur was playing a character also, that of Archetypal India.  And in many ways, Octopussy's Udaipur was extremely recognizable as the one just outside the window: Tuuk-tuuks, women in bright silk, cobblestone streets rolling past Jain temples. It was an obviously likable landscape, an introduction to India for an audience that knew nothing about India.

The Monsoon Palace usually appeared at night as a pinprick of light perched above the dark Udaipur countryside; during the day, the building was indistinct on its green hill, while at night the hill all but disappeared, leaving only the floating light.
 
It was the last of Udaipur's sites that I really wanted to see. One bumpy tuuk-tuuk ride with Martin and Mariano brought us to the base of the hill, where a speed-demon behind the wheel of an SUV lugged us along the winding road to the top.
 
As I had expected, the palace was was underwhelming, startlingly derelect and crumbling. It had certainly gone to seed in the time since James Bond had spent a stint locked in one of its upstairs rooms.
 
But the surroundings were majestic. On one side, Udaipur stretched white and brightly lit between bony green hills like a land-locked Rio de Janeiro. On the other side, 180 degrees of countryside and minuscule villages stretched away into rows of mountains that marched into the sunset.
 
Plumes of smoke rose from points in the view. They were probably beacons of burning trash, but from afar, like a lot of things, they were interesting and almost scenic.
 
I nearly threw away my camera that evening in disgust, when I looked at the two contrasting images: One before me, enormous and alive, the other on my camera screen, distant and pallid.

Sitting at a restaurant that night with Martin, Mariano and two American girls we'd recently met, I felt content, but I was getting restless again. Udaipur was comfortable. I would have run across hot coals for such a placid environment in Delhi, but now something in my chest was kicking me from the inside and demanding adventure again. Maybe I'm too sensitive to these things.
 
My German friend Martin had an admirably open-minded attitude to his own travels, or maybe just couldn't express complex thoughts in English. While we were awaiting our food, he told us that he was headed towards Dehra Dun, north of Delhi, for a ten-day Vipassana meditation retreat.
 
"Why?" someone asked.
 
"Travel! Interesting!" he said with an earnest shrug. Martin was on a round-the-world trip, having quite his job at a German newspaper. Indeed, he will be on his trip long after the rest of us have put away our backpacks--three years? Four? Martin didn't know and didn't seem too worried about it.
 
We walked back towards our hostel, past a festival that had turned the streets into a raucous playground. A man in a pointed hat, painted and dressed into the visage of a fever-dream clown, leered at the encircling crowd while he sang an upbeat number that didn't match his costume. It was late, and Mariano at least was so uncomfortable that he turned on his heel and went back to the hostel. I stayed for a few more minutes, because it was my last night in Udaipur.

It was supposed to be my last night in Udaipur, at least.  But the city didn't let me go easily.
 
The next day, while walking up the hostel stairs, the sound of a guitar brought me to a landing where two Israelis were strumming through a Ray Charles piece. They invited me to lunch with them across the lake, and I had accepted, envisioning the departure time on my bus ticket to Mumbai and knowing I was toying with fate.
 
We sat on cushions around low tables with a dozen other Israelis and ate Israeli food. It was a particular kind of establishment, complete with a chummy manager and testimonials scribbled on the walls in half a dozen languages. The minutes floated away, and my scramble to the bus station was in vain: I had failed to report half an hour early at the designated reporting time, possibly the only time in history that an Indian bus actually left the minute it was supposed to.
 
There was a silver lining to my lateness, however: I collided out of the blue with two old friends from Shanghai, Amelia and Andriana, and we made tentative plans to reune in Varanasi.
 
I was still reeling from that encounter when I made my second attempt to leave, I reported on time, but the intersection was such a crush of vehicles that I failed to find the right one. I walked amid the bustle and fumes in consternation. The irritated travel agent I had purchased my ticket from had seen me miss my ride the previous day, and he had the decency to phone the bus to stall. I chased it down in a sweaty and disheveled walk of shame.
 
I scooped up the remainder of my dignity and took it with me to Mumbai. Exit Udaipur and Rajasthan.
