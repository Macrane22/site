It's worth taking a look at the world's most expensive residence just to be underwhelmed but it. A couple of people pointed it out to me while we waited for a bus in the grey and drizzling heart of Mumbai. Incredibly, Mumbai has no metro, and the buses were marked with Hindi numerals, which I had not seen thus far and couldn't read.  So there was a small posse of Indians ready to guide me onto the right vehicle, and for this I was grateful.
 
I followed their fingers to a point in the skyline just a few blocks away. The residence in question was an anonymous grey thing, drab concrete and windows, one trunk in a sprawling urban jungle. Even to an observant passerby, it wouldn't have been worth a glance.
 
I think this $1 billion vertical heap is a good summary of Mumbai itself, at least on the outside: In a city always billed as an epic playground of rich and poor, the two seemed to have meshed together to create something in the middle, but a little closer to the poor side than to the rich.
 
Right off the bus from Udaipur, I had met a friendly local named Pauru, who generously took it upon himself to show me around the city.
 
He took me out for a cup of chai at a classic Indian-style chai stall: The milky sweet tea came in a small glass not much larger than a shot glass, and we drank it by the side of the road. Pauru pointed out his weight-lifting teacher, a former Olympic athlete, from afar. In terms of girth, Pauru was an Olympian himself.
 
He looked different from any Indian I'd met thus far: He was a very wide man with a boyish head stuck onto extremely broad shoulders. He kept his hair wrapped in a black bandana and was forever pulling up his clown-sized sweatpants towards his nipples and tightening the elastic, only to have them slip down again the moment he let go.
 
When I asked him about the origin of his name, just to make conversation, he told me, "I'm Parsi. Zoroastrian. Have you ever met a Zoroastrian before?"
 
"No."
 
"Well, now you have."
 
Pauru promised to guide me to a bus to my hostel in Colaba, but mentioned that he had an errand to run first.
 
Thus it was that we dropped by a dark little room that looked out onto one of Mumbai's ten thousand alleyways. There was a table in the center of the floor, around which several of Pauru's friends sat smoking and talking. I sat at the table while Pauru discussed business with the others. The sky outside had darkened and begun to rain. People would periodically drop in and out of the room, sometimes only to pick something up and leave, without addressing those assembled around the table. Pauru told me that one of his friends lived there and allowed the others to use it as a hang-out.
 
I suspected that that little room was the seat of some shady dealings: The thin, dark man across from me was packaging hash into neat little bags, and my cripplyingly limited knowledge of Hindi could pick numbers out of Pauru's speech stream: There were many of them, and he seemed to be weighing their merits.
 
As the rain let up, Pauru took me to a nearby bus stand and left me in the care of the people already lined up there. They were young men from Gujarat, pilgrims who had come to Mumbai for the start of the Ganesh festival, to "pray god," as they put it. It was they who pointed out the world's most expensive house to me, hovering uninspiringly only a few blocks away.

The next morning, I peered through the Suburban Train's window as we pulled up outside Dharavi, often claimed to be India's largest slum and an inspiration for Slumdog Millionaire. Its status as the largest slum is contested; I'm assuming that it's difficult to keep track of these things, but it hardly matters. Some hundreds of thousands of people inhabit that patch of ground enclosed by Mumbai's two railway lines.
 
I was joined by a New Zealander from my hostel called Southern (as if his parents, at a loss for a suitable name, had decided to call him after the hemisphere they resided in). The suburban railway cut a barren pathway straight down the length of Mumbai. The tracks were cut over gravel, and people walked over them in snaking lines behind the trains. I saw two kids playing cricket in a little clearing on the edge of the tracks. The batter hit the ball out onto the tracks, and after a moment of hesitation the bowler scurried across the border and snatched it up.
 
Standing in the middle of the cramped train and clinging onto an overhead bar, I had a run-in with an Aravani, an Indian transgender person. She was dressed in a sari and bedecked with jewelry. She approached me, clapped loudly and held out her hand. This, I have heard, is a common form of begging for the Aravanis. They supposedly are much despised in India, reduced to pestering people in public spaces until they receive food or money in exchange for clearing off. This one laughingly tried to pull me off the train with her, as her partner clapped her way through the car to glares from the passengers. I shook her off and maintained my space on the floor. The doors to the train were open, and men hung half inside and half out as we chugged steadily up the city's north-south seam.
 
When we reached the station, we disembarked and walked across an elevated footbridge into Dharavi. On either side of us, a tangled mass of shantyhouses sprung from the ground. Their walls were made of every material imaginable, but the roofs uniformly wore little grey TV satellites that poked into the sky like periscopes. Concrete highrises with dead-eyed barred windows rose above the shantytown, their only sign of life the ropes of laundry hanging across the molding balconies.
 
Dharavi was bustling. As we walked into the slum, Southern and I passed knots of schoolkids in uniform and day laborers. Fruit and vegetable vendors with their wares on blankets and mats lined the cobblestoned streets. We came to an intersection, looked at one another, and impulsively took a right. The same thing happened a bit farther on, And then again.
 
When we arrived at a main road, we cut up a small alley that was little more than an exposed crack between two buildings. I felt a little as though I were diving into deep water. The buildings rising on either side of us conspired to blot out the sun, and our pathway between the drainage ditches was just wide enough for one person.
 
To either side, domestic life thrived in closet-sized spaces. It was like standing on a conveyor belt as doorways passed and I caught a glimpse of a man sitting on the edge of a bed, a woman shooing children out the door. Sometimes there were clearly a dozen people inhabiting a single room. Then the alley burst out onto the brightness of a main street again.
 
The main roads were lined with pharmacies, convenience stories and every other amenity necessary for city living. In fact, there was little to distinguish it as a slum. We dove back into the alleyways again, past courtyards and parking lots that were shin-deep in trash.
 
The sky started to darken quite suddenly. This was monsoon season, after all. As the rain came down in heavy drops, we pulled ourselves underneath an enclosure with a gaggle of schoolkids. All of them wanted at least two handshakes, one in greeting and one in farewell. That is, the boys did. In typical Indian fashion, the boys were eager to engage, but the girls stood in a separate knot 20 feet away, whispering and pointing.
 
The children, we gathered, were on break for the beginning of the Ganesh festival. They pointed to a temple on our right, and said, "pray god," very earnestly. It was beginning to sink in at this point that holidays in India are still holy days.
 
A little farther on, the street turned into a stretch of cobblestones lined with neat one-story residences that stood wall to wall like elementary school classrooms. There was a shrine to Ganesh just across from them, the statue of the many-limbed elephant god decked out in his festive best, presiding over offerings of incense and food.  It was a little Indian cul-de-sac, an extremely tranquil place. We sat under the shrine's roof as the rain started in earnest once again, hammering on the roofs and turning loose dirt into running puddles. An ambulance pulled up to a house at the far end of the block to the sound of a woman's wailing. We gave into the rain and sloshed our way out of Dharavi and back into the urban chaos of the surrounding city.
 
I think there's a cloying guilt attached to visiting places like Dharavi. Inherent in visiting such places is the desire to be shocked: Shocked by the poverty, shocked by the injustice, shocked by the humanity on parade. The general consensus is that life is rawer on the subcontinent than elsewhere, dirtier and richer and more pungent, more tangible and more beautiful. A visit to Dharavi is a wish to be shocked.
 
And so my return from Dharavi was tinged with disappointment that it wasn't as astonishing as I expected.  I had seen the poverty, the dernsity, and the color in other neighborhoods in other Indian cities that lack Dharavi's cache.
 
Dharavi was most surprising for what it lacked, not what it contained: There were no beggars. There were no rickshaw-wallahs eyeing me from their vehicles. There were no greasy touts schmoozing at my shoulder. There was virtually nothing like that at all. A couple of passersby asked Southern and I what we were doing there, but most adults looked right through us.
 
The people of Dharavi were just going about their daily business, and had little interest in two shaggy and disheveled westerners grubbing around their neighborhood.

That wasn't necessarily true in Colaba, the southernmost tip of the Mumbai peninsula, the portion of the city that most visitors see, and my home for that week.
 
I was standing on the walkway by the Colaba waterfront one day, when a man approached me from behind and stuck a pointy metal instrument in my ear, extracting a viscous hunk of earwax. I jumped away in alarm as he closed in on the other ear. He gestured that he wanted me to pay him for this service, and I shakily told him to screw off.
 
I wasn't invisible in Colaba, but it was an attractive part of the city. Imposing stone buildings overlooked the wide, tree-lined boulevards. Little alleyways crammed with meat skewer shops, and even pubs, were a minute's walk from anywhere.
 
The waterfront was home to the Taj Hotel, famous within India as an icon of luxury. The Salvation Army Red Shield Guesthouse, where I slept, was just across the street from the Taj: Our dorm window looked out onto its imposing stone edifice. Attached to the Taj was one of the swankiest Starbucks I had ever seen, and just outside that were the cookfires and ragged clutter of the street families whose children were always laughing, running up and down the street. India was always India.
 
The Salvation Army Red Shield Guesthouse is the closest I hope I ever come to living in a homeless shelter. Breakfast was included in the price of our dorm, and was served early in the morning. Each day at 7 am, I slid a little ticket over the cafeteria counter, and in return received a little plate with one hard-boiled egg, a pocket-sized banana, two slices of white bread and a dollop of jam that was sufficient to cover three quarters of one slice. I carried my plate to one of the little cafeteria tables arranged in the dining area, and ate under the vigil of the faces hanging on the walls: Mother Theresa, a very Caucasian Jesus, a miniature Santa Claus with his mittened hand waving a merry greeting, and the wizened founder of the Red Cross, who I took for Charles Darwin until I read the inscription below the picture.
 
We in the male foreigners' dorm usually clustered around one small table and compared portions of jam, as though we were in middle school again. But this boarding school atmosphere was an acceptable price to pay for the opportunity to stay in the spartan bunks upstairs. Mumbai was more expensive than almost anywhere else in India, and I'd heard a grim story or two about other budget accommodation in the city.
 
One night, Southern and I took a stroll around the Colaba waterfront, where we found an exemplary cafeteria-style restaurant that served masalas for 40,000 rupees. That's about 65 cents, which even in the cheapest corners of India is a considerable bargain. We wanted to follow up this victory with a cheap beer, so we stepped into a regal-looking bar called Leopold's. We took one look at the drink list, balked at the number of zeros attached to the prices, and walked out again.
 
Later I learned that Leopold's had been an epicenter of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. The Taj Hotel, twenty feet from my guesthouse, had been the attacks' ground zero, where the militants came ashore and killed dozens of people. The attacks were still evidently fresh in people's consciousness: All over Mumbai I saw yellow signs with the words "Play police, get rewarded!" written in large black letters.
 
Leopold's also features heavily in Gregory David Roberts's Shantaram; I wish I had been aware of the bar's venerability when I stepped in there. Roberts describes an underworld den of smugglers, crime lords and prostitutes, although the only customers I noticed in there were three hoity-toity young women.
 
Maybe the city has moved on since Roberts was there; but then again, maybe it hasn't. One of my other dorm-mates, An Israeli-American with dreadlocks who was recently discharged from the Peace Corps in Kenya, arranged an underground tour with a local alcoholic guide. He would come back to the dorm to recount his tour guide's increasingly eccentric ramblings and reelings through Mumbai's gritty underbelly and red-light districts.
 
Not having a guide myself, I was left to explore the teeming metropolis on my own. The one resident in Salvation Army who knew anything about Mumbai was a German named Eric, a who had volunteered with Colaba street children. He knew the city sights, but when anyone asked him about one, he'd cock his head to the side and shrug uninspiringly. Apparently everything in Mumbai was very, very far away, and not really worth seeing anyway.
 
My excursion to Dharavi was one stab into the mass of Mumbai. I made another into Bandra, north of Colaba on the Arabian Sea coast. I had no more concrete reason to go there other than that I'd heard that it was a haunt of Bollywood stars, and I was hoping to see Mumbai's glitzier side. I went with a British couple from Salvation Army named Xavier and Hester. We stepped off the Suburban Train at Bandra station into an explosion of rickshaws. There were no rickshaws in Colaba, which was too posh a neighborhood to allow them.
 
Maybe we plied the wrong streets, because we never saw any signs of Bollywood excess: As we walked toward the coast, high rises were stacked along both sides of the leafy roads, but each time we came to one that looked well-upkept, there was one directly after it with mold-fuzzed sides and dingy windows. Luxury didn't appear to extend more than two feet beyond the compound walls.
 
When we broke onto the beach, we were greeted with a salty wind blowing over a long strip of brown sand sheltered by mangroves. The mangroves were draped in strips of colorful cloth that fluttered in their branches, trash left behind by retreating high tides, third world tinsel. A band of squatters sat around a fire on the sand to our left, and a couple was perched arm in arm on the rocky debris in front of us.
 
As we walked along the coast, shantytowns extended on our other side, with those dungeonesque high-rises overlooking them. They were just shantytowns, but because they were on the ocean, and their tarpaulin roofs and walls were flapping in the sea breeze, they looked almost appealing and homely.
 
We strolled for a couple of hours. A little village emerged in front of us, a cobbled maze of rickshaws and markets.  It was the most idyllic corner of India I'd seen, the closest to my imagination of what India would be like: There were women in brightly-colored saris selling vegetables, and little homes above storefronts. We walked into a covered fish market where there were as many cats and herons prowling the pungent aisles as customers. Once again, I'd escaped into an India that existed regardless and in spite of my presence.
 
Xavier, Hester and I came to a halt somewhere within the maze. It was a hot, sunny day, and our energy was flagging. While we were sweating and debating our next move, a regal woman in a bright sari emerged from one of the houses in front of us and smilingly waved us inside the doorway. Usually, this would be the pretext to an invitation to buy pashminas or to book a houseboat in Srinagar, but I had a good feeling about this neighborhood.
 
Inside the houses cool atrium, chairs and couches had been arranged into a semicircle around a table, on top of which sat a statue of many-armed elephant god Ganesh, bedecked with garlands and resplendent with flowers, sweets and incense. Half a dozen family members sat around the statue, regarding it silently. Apart from two little boys playing in a corner, no one said anything. The couch was occupied by a rubbery-faced old couple who looked like they hadn't exchanged a word in twenty years. If you were to replace the Ganesh statue with a television, the scene would make sense, because it's the one that has existed in most western households for decades.
 
Our hostess offered us seats and brought samples of sweets and lavender milkshakes on a tray. She seemed to be the head of household now; her husband, she told us in good English, was in the merchant navy in Amsterdam. I could see a framed picture of them, a couple of Bollywood-worthy attractiveness (perhaps this was as close to Bollywood as we needed to get), on top of a refrigerator to my right. I spotted at least three refrigerators from my vantage point, although not a single television, computer or stereo.
 
More family members came in, some bearing offerings that they deposited in front of Ganesh. An Aravani came to the door, clapped piercingly, and left when our hostess gave her a handful of food. One of the newly arrived family members, a gregarious large woman with a tattoo visible on her bare shoulder, invited us to eat. She took us out to a courtyard framed by the surrounding houses, where we ate thalis with the rest of the family. Because it was festival time, the woman said, the neighborhood ate and cooked communally. Our trays were refilled until either we couldn't eat anymore or we couldn't take the spice. Then we thanked our hosts and set off back into the streets.
 
My last stop in Mumbai was one of its well-known beaches, somewhere on its long stretch of western coast. I didn't linger long. As Xavier, Hester and I pulled up in a rickshaw, three little boys pelted toward us and grabbed at our water bottles and our pockets. Escaping them was like shaking off a dog with its teeth around your ankle, and they chased us out onto the crowded sand, where fully-clothed people were playing in the waves. Snack vendors, photographers and friendly locals who wanted to chat guaranteed that this wouldn't be a relaxing beach visit.
 
A chipped statue of Ganesh lay half-buried in the sand, a relic of a previous year's festival. It was a little strange to see an object that had clearly been holy at one point discarded like trash. How it came to be washed up on that beach would become more clear to me in a couple days' time, but at that moment it seemed like another contradiction in a city that I already couldn't pretend I understood.
