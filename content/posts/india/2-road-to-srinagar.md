Estimates of the travelling time between Jammu and Srinagar vary, but I think it took us about 10 hours.  The road quickly winds up the mountains from Jammu, where it spends the first two-thirds of the trip coasting along the edges of the Kashmiri valleys.
 
The drive gave me plenty of time to become acquainted with my western travelmate.  His name was Yury, from St. Petersburg.  Any perception that he was a run-of-the-mill backpacker like me didn’t last long.
 
“I drive cycle,” he said, holding imaginary handlebars, “all over India.”
 
“Motorcycle?”
 
“No, no, bicycle.  I drive all over India, five months.  100 kilometers a day.  Very good for this
part,” indicating his quads.
 
It transpired that Yury had yet to sleep in any kind of organized accommodation.  He carried a tent with him, which he pitched beside the road, in the jungle, under an overpass or whatever.  The rest of the time he bunked up with whatever holy man he happened to be travelling with.  These included a Buddhist monk and an assortment of Hindu religious leaders who had invited Yury into their ashrams.
 
Two things in particular stood out about the drive:  One was the assortment of alpine homes and hotels with bright blue and green roofs that dotted the mountainsides and valley floors.  These contrasted with the ramshackle and tiny shops that directly lined the roads, just two or three walls with a man squatting in the open face between a few hanging bags of apricots.
 
But the feature of the journey that reminded me that yes, I’m in Kashmir, were the convoys of Indian army Humvees that trundled past us, sometimes dozens at a time.  Later in the journey the vehicles gave way to restless Indian troops standing along the roadside with AK-47s, but the military presence remained visible all the way into Srinagar.  Growing up I knew Kashmir as a zone on the map demarcated by dotted lines.  Today it takes a distant backseat to Tibet and Palestine in Western discussions of unpopular occupations.  Yet Kashmir remains the most militarized zone in the world based on the occupier-to-civilian ratio.  For the next week, I wouldn’t really be in India at all.
 
Yury’s company made me feel even more foreign, and I spent most of the drive acknowledging the fact that my only western companion was someone who, at least initially, I could barely relate to at all.  Never having met a Russian at this depth before, to me Yury often seemed to fulfill every stereotype (“Russian average time assemble Ak-47, 20 seconds.  Me, 14 seconds.  Very good.  Super.”).  There was his recent employment as an engineer in a weapons manufacturer, his son-of-Putin-esque passport photo, and his stories of brawls on icy lakes in Russia where a priest blesses the proceedings before hundreds of fighters charge at each other in a medieval way.  He also had a decidedly dismissive attitude towards the American military’s capabilities and morals.
 
After that, though, not much about Yury made sense without banishing all preconceptions of how Russians, or most humans, should behave. He was 20 shades darker now, had grown out his hair, and was loafing around in loose-fitting clothes, most of which were gifts from Indians he had met over the course of his travels.  He didn’t drink, smoke, or eat meat or eggs, didn’t believe in modern medicine, not even vitamins (fairy dust, inventions of the pharmaceutical industry), wasn’t convinced humans needed food to survive at all; he distrusted computer games, and at least once admitted a Buddhist attitude towards killing insects.  He had shown up in India five months ago with $500, no vaccinations and no medications. “Box.  American mind like box, like this,” he said, making a TV screen around his head with his hands and peering out of it with doughy eyes.  That was his favorite counterpoint to anything I said about the above subjects.
 
I think that India attracts people like Yury more so than anywhere else in the world.  With the place drenched in yoga and spirituality, it makes sense that it’s the mecca of some very alternative people.  But that doesn’t mean they’re common, so despite his exasperating open-mindedness, if that’s the appropriate word, I appreciated listening to (much of) what Yury had to say.
 
As we drove into the evening we passed a several-kilometer stretch of road crammed full of shops that sold nothing but cricket bats.  Supposedly Kashmiri bats are famous and are some of the world’s best.  The fields behind the cricket stores also supply much of India’s saffron, but there’s nothing to see this time of year.
 
Soon we were passing the army base on the outskirts of Srinagar, and Yury began to talk about his reason for coming this way in the first place.
 
“Father waiting for me in Srinagar.  I stay at his home.”
 
“Your father’s in India?”
 
“Yes, yes. Indian father.  We meet in Delhi and he sell me cycle.  He lives in this territory.”
 
At Yury’s invitation, I decided to accompany him to meet his adoptive father, rather than hightailing it straight to the Lonely Planet-recommended guesthouses.
 
Yury’s father lives in a house on the edge of Dal Lake in the middle of Srinagar.  Dal is the beating heart of Srinagar and the main reason anyone makes the trip up here.  Its 500 ornate houseboats attract literal boatloads of domestic tourists, and you can’t walk too far in Delhi or Srinagar without someone trying to offer you a room in one.
 
As Yury and I walked through town, we made our way to the Boulevard directly across from the rows of houseboats, which were brightly lit this time of night.  We walked down the Boulevard to hire a shikara, a uniquely Kashmiri boat with a heart-shaped oar that’s used to go short distances on the lake.
 
We crossed the lake to the home of Yury’s Kashmiri father, which sat on stilts between several houseboats.  The father was named Rahim, a middle-aged man with a white beard dressed in the traditional Muslim all-white.  He was genuinely warm and friendly, and invited Yury and me to sit down to dinner.  He told me that he had returned home to Srinagar from Delhi due to the deaths of three family members, and also to observe Ramadan.  After some insisting on Rahim’s part I decided to stay at his house, along with Yury.
 
As a temporary member of Rahim’s household, I had the privilege to observe Kashmiri Muslim customs starting from that first dinner.  We sat cross-legged in a circle in the main living room, with the serving dishes and cups in the middle.  By “we” I mean the males, of whom there seemed to be six or seven in the household.   I was never clear on exactly how everyone was related.  The women, aged 14 to 65, served the meal and exited to eat in the kitchen.  We took the rice and soupy vegetables, mixed them in our bowls, and shoveled them into our mouths with our hands.  A lot of slurping was involved.  The women brought out a bowl of sheep’s feet, which I believe is a delicacy, and I was encouraged to take one. The only adjective I’ll use to describe it is “soft,” fleshily soft, and I’ll never eat another one again uncoerced, but I checked it off my gastronomical bucket list.
 
The two staples of every meal were hard Kashmiri bread and Kashmiri tea, which was sweet, full of cinnamon and cardamom, and excellent.  After dinner we unrolled our bedrolls and went to sleep in the living room.  I would end up enjoying Rahim’s hospitality for five more nights.
