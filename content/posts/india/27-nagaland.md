---

When I decamped from the bus onto Sonari’s dusty main street, I was the farthest from home I’d ever been.  For one thing, I didn’t look the same as before.  The lower half of my face was overrun by a growth that looked like someone else’s facial hair had been glued onto my chin in a hurry.  My travel pants that I am sure had been form-fitting in Delhi were now flapping around my legs with room to spare.
 
More to the point, however, I had finally fulfilled my ambition to escape from the well-beaten path, to stop driving in others’ tire tracks and pull off the road into uncharted territory.  I was in Sonari now, which was almost the same thing as being nowhere.  It had been a full two days of travel to get here, and I was still short of my destination, although I hadn’t worked out how I would get there.
 
The day after returning to my room on Majuli Island to find Morgan gone, I had thrown on my backpack and departed the monastery.  I stopped at an internet café in the main town, where I bought a plane ticket.  For the first time, my Indian sojourn had an expiration date:  I had about a week to be back in Calcutta.
 
But how best to occupy myself in the meantime?  A week was a long time.  I had a well-thumbed Northeast States atlas that I had bought in Darjeeling, and I flipped through it in search of inspiration.  Any aspiration to go to Arunachal Pradesh had died with Morgan’s departure.  I did want to go to Mizoram, which droops south between Myanmar and Bangladesh, but its capital, Aizawl, was a 36-hour bus ride away.
 
So I settled instead on Nagaland, another diminutive dollop of a state, which borders Assam to the east and didn’t look too far.  I clicked around online and found the email of a guide named Longshah who supposedly specialized in taking foreigners into the outer reaches of Nagaland’s tribal Mon region.  I sent him a message expressing my interest in visiting.
 
With this fragment of a plan, I boarded the ferry from Majuli Island, clambered into a van on the other side with thirteen or fourteen people occupying half as many seats (including one of the driver’s friends clinging to the outside), and found myself in Jorhat again.
 
 
I had two missions in Jorhat.  The first was to buy a train ticket back to Calcutta five days down the road, so that I could catch my flight.  This turned out to be much easier said than done.
 
Despite well-meaning directions, it took two hours for me to find the station, which was really just a quiet and leafy platform on the outskirts of town.  I gave the man behind the reservations desk a little slip of paper expressing my desire to buy a ticket from Jorhat to Calcutta five days hence.  He took the slip, punched a few keys on his computer, shook his head and wrote something next to my handwriting.  He passed it back to me, and I saw “WAITLIST: 47” or something like that scribbled in capital letters.  For the next few minutes, we passed the piece of paper back and forth, me increasingly frantic as I adjusted my station and date of departure, he increasingly irritated.  Eventually I gave up.  From the few words I could gather from him, there was a festival that week.  Every train, every single one, was thus booked.
 
I was disconsolate and disappointed.  A 24-hour train journey had seemed like a suitable wrap-up to India.
 
I ran into rough seas on my other mission in Jorhat as well, as it became clear that reaching Nagaland was somewhat less than straightforward.  My Northeast States atlas suggested that the best way to reach Mon, where I wanted to go, was by way of a small Assamese town called Sonari.  A conversation with a pair of travel agents revealed that Sonari itself was at least two hops removed from Jorhat.
 
The sky was darkening by the time I pulled myself into a rickshaw.  The ragged driver dropped me on the roadside, where a line of vans awaited passengers out of Jorhat.  I don’t remember how I knew to come there.  I was  however used to the routine: sitting in the passenger seat, keeping one eye on my bag in the back while the van’s owners paced around, spitting and shouting out to passersby.  Another passenger came, then another two.  Once the vehicle was full, we drove out into rural Assam, bound for Sibsagar.
 
I didn’t want to be in Sibsagar at all, but there I was.  It was nighttime, and I was squinting at the pages of Lonely Planet, scanning for the address of the single recommended budget hotel in town.  I wasn’t in Nagaland yet, but I could tell I was in an un-touristed part of the world by the frequency with which I stopped to shake hands with strangers.  As I turned onto my hotel’s street, a cadre of Assamese policemen greeted me warmly, and just beyond them a salesman grabbed my arm and implored me to come admire his washing machines.  I don’t think I had the look of a likely customer, being ragged and obviously in an itinerant state, but I certainly need a wash.  In my hotel room half an hour later, looking at my reflection in the mirror, I was slightly alarmed by my appearance for the first time.  I left my changes of clothes in a bucket of dirty water and walked up the street for a plate of disappointing faux chow mein.
 
On the way back from dinner, I passed a large sign proclaiming “Oil Flows, Nation Grows!” in big letters.  It was little things like that, so contrary to what I knew back in the USA, that compelled me to keep travelling.
 
The next morning I went through my usual sweaty and confused ritual of identifying the right vehicle in the right parking lot to carry me to my next destination.  In this case, that destination was Sonari, which meant I was almost in Nagaland.
 
Thus it was that the bus spilled me out into Sonari, a town of 17,000 people, later that day.  I immediately began the Ritual again, asking people for the Mon bus, following a breadcrumb trail of half-hearted shrugs and pointing fingers up the main street.  When I reached the trail’s end, there was no sign of a bus or van anywhere in sight.  I had no evidence that there was a bus to Mon that day, or even that week.
 
At that point, as I began to ask for directions anew, a bystander took a close look at me and jogged to a snack stand across the street, where he prodded a man buying groceries.
The man turned around and approached me, holding out his hand.  “Matthew?  I’m Longshah from Longwa.”
 
Longshah had only stopped in Sonari for about ten minutes of shopping; his groceries turned out to consist primarily of liquor.  That I had encountered him in this narrow window, and that he had deduced the lost-looking foreigner wandering the streets of Sonari must be the same one who emailed him a few days before hoping to meet in Mon, was very coincidental.  It was lucky, too, because Longshah told me there was no public transport to Mon that day.
 
He had a car, a sleek black sedan with a little official flag saluting from the front hood.   I climbed in to the back seat, next to an elderly man with a folded spine and eyes lost in wrinkles.  Longshah sat in the passenger seat and a young guy with a mullet piloted us out of Sonari, through tea fields and across the border into Nagaland.  We had a bit of time to remark on the fortuitousness of encountering each other like this before we pulled over at a police outpost.  As of a few years ago, Nagaland no longer requires foreigners to hold special permits, but they must still register at every point on their journey.  I handed over copies of my passport and visa to two heavily-armed Indian policemen and got back in the car.  100 feet down the road we went through the same routine again.
 
There were few interruptions after that.  We drove out into poor-looking farmland and woods, and began to climb into the hills.
 
Longshah had Asian features, a shaved head and kind eyes.  He told me that in addition to working as a guide for foreigners, he was an assistant to some Nagamese public official.  That explained the car.  A sleek black sedan would look out of place almost anywhere in rural India, but doubly so here near the border.  People turned to stare as we drove past.  We passed a few large buses going in the opposite direction and looking out of place on the hilly switchbacks, but otherwise encountered no other vehicles.
 
As we climbed deeper into the hills, however, we began to encounter quite a bit of foot traffic.  Lines of women trudged along the side of the road, their backs bent at 45-degree angles with baskets of firewood on their backs, which were secured by straps around their foreheads.  They ranged from children to very elderly.
 
Knots of barefoot men stood along the roadside with rifles slung over their shoulders.  Longshah told me from the front seat that the Indian government relaxes its restrictions on firearm possession in Nagaland.  The Nagamese manufacture all their guns and ammunition in their own villages.  The weapons I saw would have looked perfectly in place in a Civil War reenactment.  They stared as Longshah’s shiny black car drove past.
 
We arrived in Mon Town after dark.  It was yet another hill town, but the strings of lights spread along the ridges were more threadbare and uneven than they had been in Shimla or Darjeeling or Shillong.  Mon was a much poorer place. It had only a single guesthouse, according to Lonely Planet, so I accepted Longshah’s invitation to stay at his house instead.
 
We pulled into a driveway and disembarked into a little knot of people.  Half a dozen little kids pattered around the driveway and tugged at their parents’ hems while Longshah’s wife helped him unpack the car.
 
The house was spread across several buildings.  The main room and two bedrooms were well-lit, with a TV constantly tuned to Bollywood soap operas.  Presently Longshah directed me up to the kitchen, a standalone structure which lay up a rocky path.  Unlike the TV room, it had no electricity:  Its only light came from a firepit in the middle of the floor, where a teenage boy was squatting next to a cooking pot.  He didn’t say anything, but spooned some rice and daal into a bowl and handed it to me.  The two other men from the car journey walked in and took bowls too.  Then three teenage girls came in.  They sat in a little knot and whispered, shooting looks in my direction.
 
I was feeling a little on edge, but I was rescued by the arrival of Longshah’s younger brother Nokao, a smiling 17-year-old.  He shook my hand and launched into animated conversation, even coercing the girls into exchanging a few giggling words with me.
 
I spent four or five days with Longshah’s family, just enough to begin to fall into their daily routine.  Most of that time we spent in Longwa, their village, which was two hours from Mon across fields and hills and which I sometimes confused with Longshah’s name.  Longwa was home to Longshah’s parents’ longhouse, a large one-room structure with an earthen floor and animal skulls hanging along the walls.  Traditionally the Nagamese were head-hunters, although the last human head was hunted decades ago.   Their rifles still claimed plenty of animal heads, and it was alleged that there were stashes of human skulls available for discrete viewing.
 
Longwa lay along a single road that wound along a spiny ridge.  Here at last was the end of India:  approaching on the Mon road, the left side of the ridge fell away into Nagaland, the right into Myanmar.  Soon after that, the road just ended, acknowledged by a concrete placard erected by India’s Border Roads Organization:  Kilometer 0: Border Restrained Us, Otherwise We Would Have Gone Much Beyond.  As if to emphasize the remoteness, there was an overgrown helicopter landing pad nearby.  Nokao and I hiked up to a pinnacle that marked the official India-Myanmar border, where a borderstone stood with Hindi inscribed on one side and Burmese on the other.
 
We also paid a visit to Longwa’s headman, who occupied a traditional longhouse half in India and half in Myanmar.  We were greeted inside by three or four emaciated men sitting around the firepit with opium pipes.  They wore jewelry on their legs and necks, and one or two of them had faces tattooed bluish-gray.  One of them, a droopy-eyed man wearing a wide-brimmed hat, was the headman.  Next to the doorway were two tables arranged with slightly crude souvenirs:  Beads, wooden cups and carved opium pipes.  I paced around the room, taking in the animal skulls hanging from the ceiling like bells, bronze shields and pairs of carved oxen horns.  Next to the firepit was a rusting metal chair that had evidently been excavated from a crashed World War II fighter jet.
 
Thinking it was a good novelty, I bought an opium pipe and, at Nokao’s suggestion, handed the headman a small fee for the privilege of stepping into his hall.  When we left, the men were still sitting vacantly around the firepit with their opium pipes.
 
Idleness and opium dominated by perception of Nagaland.  They appeared to be indelibly linked in Nagamese masculine culture.  The women were different.  Longshah told me on the drive from Sonari to Mon that in Nagamese culture women worked hard.   My first glimpse of this had been of the lines of women laboring up the slopes to Mon under baskets of firewood.  My second impression had come the next morning, before we set out from Mon for Longwa, when Longshah brought me along to a meeting with an acquaintance.  The meeting was conducted around the firepit, the participants were glistening shirtless men, the refreshments opium and tea.  But it had been a harried-looking woman who had answered the door, and the clatter of pots from the kitchen one room over was accompanied only by female voices.

Nokao had little interest in opium, but he was forever ducking out of his older brother’s sight to shake the contents of a small paan bag into his palm before sweeping the whole thing into his mouth.  Paan was more popular and accessible than tobacco here.  I had seen the stained red lips already in Meghalaya, particularly among women, and Heprit in Cherrapunjee had shown Morgan and me a folktale that explained how paan had first come to grow in this part of India (It involved a friendship between a rich man and a poor man, but the details are fuzzy).
 
The Nagamese appeared to be particularly fond of it. In Mon, Nokao’s younger sister had shaken shown a small packet of the red-grey dust into my hand and demonstrated how to hold it at the front of mouth.  She and Nokao almost always had a telltale bulge in the lower lip and slightly slurred speech.  Incidentally, I don’t believe I ever saw a cigarette in Nagaland.
 
Nokao and I spent most of our time visiting various friends and family members in Longwa and the surrounding villages.  He took me to meet one of his older sisters, who lived in Longwa with her husband and young son.  When we arrived at her house, a rounded building with a thatched roof, she was shaking grain onto a mat in the center of the floor.  Her little boy paced aimlessly around the room.  Nokao and I sat on stools by the firepit and the two of them chatted in Nagamese.  On our way out, the sister gave me a large orange cucumber larger than my forearm as a parting gift.  In her backyard, marijuana plants much taller than me swayed gently against a backdrop of green and golden hills.
 
The next day, Nokao and I stopped by the home of Longshah’s wife’s family, who lived in a neighboring village in the valley below Longwa.  I brought a gift of my own this time, a package of biscuits I had purchased at a roadside stand.  We were greeted at the door by Longshah’s father-in-law and his two teenage daughters and led into the main room.  All of the features I had come to associate with Nagamese dwellings were there:  The naturally lit large room with an earthen floor, the firepit in the middle heating a tea kettle, animal skulls mounted on the wall above two rifles.  I pulled out the bag of biscuits I had brought and offered them to the father.  He accepted them with obvious appreciation and cracked them open.  They proved to be so unpleasantly chalky and bland that I retrieved the torn packaging and scrawled down the manufacturer’s contact information, all the while composing an eloquently nasty letter of complaint in my head.  I subsequently lost the slip of paper.
 
More jarring and memorable than the biscuits were the stares of the two daughters, who sat against the wall and outside of the circle of conversation.  It wasn’t their looking at me but the blankness of the expressions that got to me.  It had been a long time since I had seen such a young person sit in the same place, with nothing to distract her but the walls or the quiet movements of three people eating and talking in front of her.  It was strange to see, and strange to realize it was strange.  Occasionally one of the girls rose to shake more cereal into the snack bowl we were munching from or poke at the embers.  Otherwise they barely moved.
I began to feel acutely aware of the smallness of their world.  After leaving the in-laws’ house, Nokao took me to the soccer pitch where the Longwa team practiced.  The views from the pitch were beautiful:  The pitch sat on a hilltop with views of the surrounding valleys, its grass bright green in the sunlight.  Longwa on its ridge was just out of sight.
 
We met up with one of Nokao’s friends, a scrawny and shaggy-haired boy who lived in a little house next to the pitch and just above the high school.  His job, Nokao told me, was to ring the bell that marked the start and end of each class period.  “Is very good job,” Nokao said satisfactorily, sucking on some paan and spitting out a gob.
 
Nokao told me that he had never been out of Nagaland but wanted to visit Mumbai and Delhi.  Nagaland is a little smaller than Connecticut and Rhode Island put together.  Living close to one’s birthplace is neither unusual nor bad, but I found something about the Nagamese’s situation to be slightly sad:  They were a small appendage in the periphery of a vast country whose language, people and religion were very unlike them.

Evenings in Longshah’s longhouse followed a routine.  Although the longhouse was their home, the family was building a modern concrete house just across from it.  Many of the men in the village were at work constructing it.  Each evening they returned to the longhouse to sit on stools around the fire or squat in circles, talking to one another in husky voices.  Longshah’s wife prepared dinner over the firepit.  Dinner was sticky rice and watery yellow daal, served with a very bitter spiny vegetable and occasionally with spicy, sinewy fragments of beef.  The whole mixture was scooped into clumps and eaten with mucky hands.
 
After dinner, the men crouched around the fire and drew out their pipes.  They produced packets of opium from their pockets, which they carefully unrolled and cooked on long metal spoons over the flames.  Once the opium had boiled down to two or three muddy drops, they poured it into a mash of leaves and pressed it into the end of the pipe with practiced hands.  They put tea in long wooden tubes over the fire too.  I never saw opium smoked without tea, which was dark and bitter.  A couple of the men tried to sell me their pipes for about two dollars each.  They were simple wooden instruments, less ornate than the tourist specimen I had purchased at the headman’s longhouse.
 
The after-dinner opium lull continued until eyes were glazed over and any murmur of conversation had died down into silence.  Then the center of activity shifted from the firepit at the back of the longhouse to the TV at the front.  The villagers crowded around it, scooting their plastic chairs into a semi-circle, and tuned into WWE.
 
I watched with them as WWE’s much-adored tropes and caricatures presented themselves onscreen:  A wrestler with a vintage Soviet accent and his attendant, a blonde woman with Eastern European features exaggerated by her make-up; two Americans with arms thicker than most people’s buttocks; a gay man with long flowing hair and a voice two octaves higher than anyone else’s.  I was one of the less enraptured people in the room, but I’d seen the c-movie acting and exaggerated choreography before.  What a strange contrast it was, though, to everything else I had observed in Longwa: An hour of candycorn entertainment, watched on a single flickering TV screen in an otherwise dark building at the end of an otherwise simple day.
 
My final night I was treated to a performance in my honor by a shrill choir of five young children, including three of Longshah’s daughters.  Longshah’s parents thanked me for visiting them, speaking through Longshah’s interpretation.  I was ready to leave, but I was growing to enjoy the social feel of the evenings in the longhouse.  I went to bed fairly early, a feat made easier by the lack of electric lights in my room.

My journey from Longwa back to Guwahati was more of a retreat than a graceful exit.  No longer eager to seek contact with strangers, I tried to actively avoid them, which in India is very difficult indeed.  Discomfort had become more of a burden than a thrill.
 
A minibus picked me up outside of Longshah’s longhouse early the next morning.  The family’s waves receded into the distance as the bus lurched away down the road.
 
 
 
We stopped twice, once at a small fruit market in a neighboring village and once to let the young girl in the front seat throw up.  The road was windy and bumpy, and descended into gravel in some places.
 
Two hours later, we arrived in run-down Mon town, where I picked up a van ticket back to Sonari.  That van spilled me out by the side of the road at the Nagaland border checkpoint:  Its plates weren’t authorized to continue into Assam.
 
After a vigorous argument over the fare, I hired a rickshaw for the final leg into Sonari.  We had only been putting along for a few minutes when the sound of drums and loud music came into earshot.  The festival that had bought up every train ticket in the Northeast had found me.  The rickshaw pulled over as the procession poured past us.  People danced and walked arm in arm, garlands of Pooja flowers around their necks, their faces and clothes stained by pink and orange.  Large bedecked floats bearing tower speakers bobbed along in the revelers’ midst.  People goggled and waved at me while I sulked in the back of the rickshaw, half-concealed by the curtains pulled across the sides.	A couple of them reached in to shake my hand and bid I enjoy their beautiful Indian festival.
 
I was a little dismayed, not least because I thought I was in the middle of nowhere.  But there were people everywhere, whole villages of people in the streets, noise and color everywhere.  When we reached Sonari a few minutes later, the main street was pulsing from music emanating from several floats.  A dancing crowed had formed around each one.
 
I picked my way along the side of the street.  Enthusiastic hands grabbed my forearms and tried to drag me into the center of the action.  I soon had a little knot of people tagging after me, inviting me to dance.  One man pulled out his phone and snapped a side profile of my face as I hurried along.  I scampered to the other side of the road and asked for directions of the Guwahati bus.  In reply, a bystander nodded eagerly and tried to pull my backpack off, motioning towards the center of the dancing fray.
 
I hurried off again, finally stopping in front of an older couple who had set up lawn chairs outside of their house and were watching the festivities quietly.  They pointed up the road, and I arrived at the little bus station minutes later, sweating from the heat and my own quick pace.
The station’s dark interior was a welcome refuge from the commotion outside.  I talked for a few minutes to the mustached man behind the counter and sat down at a table.  The mustached man ducked outside, leaving me alone for the moment.  He returned a few minutes later with his five children in tow.  He arranged them in a line and, to my embarrassment and theirs, had each one of them step forward and shake my hand, while he looked on smiling broadly.
 
Four hours later, with dusk falling and the street quiet, I boarded the bus to Guwahati.  Apart from a rest stop in Sibsagar, I spent the journey with my back side sunk as deep into the padded seat as possible, my eyes either focused on the scenery passing by or closed.
 
We arrived at the Guwahati bus station sometime after 4 am.  I lugged my backpack to one of the Spartan metal chairs lining the lobby, selected Bruce Springsteen on my iPod, and fell asleep in a folded position.  Once it was light out, I found a rickshaw to the airport, where I spend a few minutes marveling at the modern interior, the check-in counters, the overhead PA system.
 
I was in Calcutta by the end of the day.
