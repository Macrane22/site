Shimla, Himachal's capital, is a nearly vertical town, and the ascent from the Old Bus Stand to the YMCA was laughably steep. The YMCA was a relic of British rule--Shimla was the summer capital of British India. It took about an hour to find it, because it was early morning and I had a hard time tracking down people to ask for directions. Shimla might boast British architecture, but it was still northern India: Things go dead at 9 pm and don't bother to reopen for 13 hours. 7 am is still the witching hour.
 
In honor of India's impending independence day, August 15, Shimla's main boulevard played host to some very ponderous military parades. There were army and navy cadets in site, as well as what appeared to be the Indian military's equivalent of girl scouts and boy scouts.
 
"Enjoying it?" An Indian man next to me asked, gesturing at the rows of uniforms marching past.
 
"Yes," I lied.
 
The only reason I was in Shimla, though, was to explore the famous temple to Hanuman, Hinduism's monkey deity. At the far end of another steep ascent, the temple boasted an enormous statue of Hanaman, so tall that his head had disappeared into the perpetual mist above.
 
Just down the ridge from the statue was the temple and, most importantly, the little guys themselves: Dozens of them, scampering along rooftops, pulling up the lawn and lapping up puddles.
 
It's no secret that monkeys are nasty creatures. Most wild animals are, something that we in the States forget sometimes, I think. But monkeys are particularly unnerving, and why not--they're quick, strong, sharp and agile. Walking under an overhanging branch on which two are three are perched raises my blood pressure.
 
The best advice for dealing with monkeys is to walk softly and carry a big stick: Visitors to the Hanuman temple are often advised to bring a walking stick with them to swat the primates away. Too many travelers have had their phones and cameras snatched by the monkeys, who will dance out of reach and return the item only when the aggrieved tourist buys them a temple snack.
 
I had no stick, only a large water bottle, when I entered into a skirmish with an especially large specimen. I don't know which of the cardinal rules I broke, whether I made eye contact, showed my teeth, or came between a mother and child.  But the monkey bared its teeth at me and things escalated quickly. I boxed it on the nose with my water bottle. It tore out the bottle's bottom with surprising ease and then came snarling, clawing at my leg. I cut my losses and retreated with a bleeding leg.
 
This called for rabies shots, despite the minute risk because the virus is transmitted through saliva. At any rate, it seemed like a good opportunity to familiarize myself with India's healthcare infrastructure. What I'd seen so far wasn't particularly reassuring: three-wall cinderblock clinics and peeling signs advertising things like "Multi Super Specialty Hospital." But the procedure for rabies turned out to be straightforward: I bought an over-the-counter vaccine and paid a small fee to a doctor to inject me. All together, one round cost about $6.
 
With my pride dampened by the primate attack, the bus from Shimla back to Delhi wasn't quite the triumphant return I'd hoped. I was closing the loop I'd begun one month before, finishing off my adventure in India's little topknot.
 
I could already see the dusty congestion when I stepped off the bus at Delhi's Kashmir Gate. It was good to be back.

Of course, it wasn't good to be back at all. My first encounter off the bus was with a rickshaw driver who swore that the metro was closed for Independence Day.  The metro turned out to be as open and packed as ever. It was reassuring that Delhi hadn't changed while I'd been gone.
 
Moreover, my hopes of glimpsing Independence Day festivities were dashed when I realized that the holiday was as much an excuse for everything to be closed and inefficient as it was for displays of patriotism.
 
I visited sites across the city, some of which were old, tall, large and culturally important. But the fact that they were located in Delhi rendered them moot in my mind. I caught my first glimpse of middle-class Delhi in the Lodi Gardens, where joggers sported yoga pants and iPods. I even had a few friendly encounters with locals, including one particularly kind security guard.
 
But with so much left to see, I wasn't interested in hanging around long enough to let Delhi redeem herself.
