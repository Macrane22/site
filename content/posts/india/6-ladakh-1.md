The bus to Leh, capital of Ladakh, pulled out of Srinagar at 7 am.  There were only about nine of us passengers, with our baggage taking up half the available seats. On the ride with me were a Lithuanian couple and a German guy who looked like a hippie Obi-Wan Kenobi. They all had yoga mats with them, and had been following the path of zen and vegetarianism across India and Nepal.
 
Turning my sights from Kashmir east into Ladakh seemed like a natural choice, particularly because I could see the Himalayas up close and enjoy the cooler temperatures that the mountains ensured. Moreover, I could continue my exploration of India’s fringe regions: Culturally, Ladakh is no more India than Kashmir is; in some ways it is a continuation of Tibet, but there is a distinct Ladakhi language and culture.
 
As we passed through the outskirts of Srinagar, the landscape remained lush, with bleary-eyed soldiers with AK-47s and bamboo riot shields posted at regular intervals. But as we climbed into the mountains the mountains became more arid and vegetation disappeared from the view.
A few hours in, we were clattering towards a dry mountain pass when traffic halted. On the road way out in front of us, a plume of dust rose into the air at the site of a landslide. As far as landslides go, this one wasn’t too bad because we were soon moving again. We passed through a place called Drass, which claimed to be the “second-coldest inhabited place on Earth,” but can’t possibly be in the top 25 (I had one of the best omelets there that I’ve ever had, though). By the time it was dark we were in Kargil, the biggest population center between Srinagar and Leh.
 
Like Srinagar, Kargil is a Muslim city, so as we arrived the streets were full of people going home, I assume, to break their fast. We found a hole-in-the-wall eatery there, where the owner complained about the “bloody stupid” Japanese tourist who had lost his passport on the premises. Little restaurants of this type, which often serve only rice, vegetables, lentils and bread, are called dhabas in India. They’re the backbone of the local culinary scene, and it’s easy to see why when 70 rupees can buy you a bloated stomach.
 
Back at the van, much to my chagrin, the driver and the Indian passengers were fiddling with the wires behind our left headlight. But like all Indian delays I’ve experienced so far, the wait was annoying but temporary. We were soon on our way again.
 
The drive up from Kargil was sublime by night, with the Himalayan villages lit up below and trees girding us in on both sides. Then, abruptly, the magic was broken when the driver pulled over without announcement and went to sleep for the next five hours. While the bus filled with chainsaw snores, I couldn’t lean back, fall forward or curl up sideways, so I twiddled my thumbs for much of the time. I might have been better off on the roof. This was far preferable to the driver falling asleep involuntarily and sending us flying back below the treeline, but I was pleased when he jerked awake and started the engine again around 6 am.
 
Leh was unimpressive at first sight from the bus. Over the past couple hours, the landscape had become incredibly arid and dusty, more of a high-altitude desert than the Himalayan kingdom I had pictured. It didn’t reveal its charms immediately off the bus either, as I stumbled around with my big backpack, feeling the 11,500 foot elevation and trying to find the damn “tinkling streams” that Lonely Planet raved about.
 
The charming part of town, it turned out, was well northwest and uphill from the bus station. Leh is what Lonely Planet calls a “backpacker enclave,” and since I’d only been in one or two of these special places before, I’ll set the scene briefly.
 
The epicenter of tourist action was Changspa road, which wound uphill for kilometers past dozens of travel agencies, bakery-cafes (all claiming to be German) and guesthouses. Most of these guesthouses were run by local families. They were usually two stories high and built around a central garden with laundry hanging across it. I stayed in two while in Leh. The rooms had shared bathrooms, perhaps a mattress on the floor, and a view through the garden of the surrounding mountains. For 250 rupees they were phenomenal.
 
The most important feature of Leh’s alternative-backpacker vibe was the people who flocked there. There were plenty of adventure tourists there for the trekking and biking, and a few families. But the dominant demographic was 25-35-year-old hippies. The per-capita rate of dreadlocks on Changspa Road was off the charts across all raced, genders and nationalities. Walking up Changspa, there was a 100% chance that you would pass a bearded guy outside a cafe strumming Space Oddity or Blowin’ in the Wind while a few onlookers drank coffee and rolled spliffs. It was very laid-back indeed.
 
This was in stark contrast to the road, six inches away, which was a typical too-narrow Indian side street. It was frequently clogged with traffic that it couldn’t flush out effectively. The engines—and the generators when the power went out, as it often did—spat out so much exhaust that you could almost feel the carbon monoxide slowly killing you. As is the Indian way, the horn was used in place of the brakes. So just walking down the road at rush was sensory overload, as you dodged motorcycles, tour vans, cows and Europeans on their way to meditation sessions.
 
If I wanted an escape I usually headed over to the Main Bazaar, just two minutes away by walking. Leh has large Muslim and Buddhist populations, and the Main Bazaar showed it—the large mosque stood at one end of the street, while Buddhist prayer flags hung across the street at intervals. There was a small vegetable market too, but most of the road was torn up for a project called “Leh Beautification.”
 
From almost any point in the city, you could see the Leh Palace sitting on its mountain and the craggy, snowcapped peaks to the south. I decided that, contrary to my initial impression, Leh was a pretty good place.
 
As its backpacker vibe promised, the travelers I met during my first nights there were an interesting mix: There was an old Australian man with an easel who was sketching Leh’s skyline—he was an expert on architecture in earthquake-risk areas. He talked at length about the demise of state-run education in Australia, which mirrors everything people say about the States. There was also a French guy in a fedora who absolutely loved the United States—his grandmother lived in Normandy during D-Day—and an Austrian guy on vacation from a program volunteering with street kids near Hyderabad.
 
There were two Czech girls, one with dreadlocks and one with gauges, Ladakhophiles who had been coming to Leh every year since they first came as volunteers restoring cave paintings in the mountains north of the city. I learned that the government has declared 2014 to be the official “Year of Czech” in India. Even the Leh Palace was hosting an exhibit of Czech castles. The two countries have historical ties too— every day I walked past the large Moravian Mission School on Changspa, where I passed groups of little girls in uniform with ties that hung down to their knees.
 
And then there were the Israelis. Once again, the local population had a low opinion of the Israeli travelers. Several times, I heard complaints that they were wild, disrespectful and unpleasant. I never saw any hint of this in the ones that I met, but I would gain more perspective on this question when I went south to Manali.
 
For now, though, my focus was on venturing out of Ley and exploring Ladakh at large.
