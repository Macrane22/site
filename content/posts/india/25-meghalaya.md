Meghalaya was Morgan’s and my second Northeast State, just a short side-excursion while we debated the merits of buying permits for Arunachal Pradesh.  There’s nowhere quite like it:  If you drive from Meghalaya in any direction, into neighboring Assam or Bangladesh, you will quickly leave behind the state’s language, ethnicity, religion and terrain and find completely new ones.  It’s an island in every sense but the literal one.
 
The monsoon was doing its best to change this.  A few kilometers out from Guwahati, the rains we were fleeing caught up with us and the highway began to flood.  The road became a river the color of weak coffee, the windshield wipers wagged furiously, and traffic slowed to a crawl.  In my memory, the water was deep enough that there were actually little waves splashing across the tires of the vehicles around us, but that’s probably a dramatic fabrication of my recollection.
 
Slowed by the flooding, we arrived in the capital Shillong after dark.  Of course, we also took a rest stop near the Assam-Meghalaya border.  On any drive in India, no matter the length, the driver would pull over at an open-air snack bar and buy a cup of chai.  I have paced around outside of more highway rest stops than I can count while the male passengers peed in lines along the edges of the road.  If they don’t want to be rushed, these drivers will not be rushed.
As we descended along the windy hill roads into Shillong, we were tired, irritable and without a place to stay.  At every hotel we inquired at, we were greeted by a curt shake of the head and a double-digit dollar price.  We finally found a vacancy at a respectable establishment, with professional staff, varnished furniture and functional lighting fixtures.  None of that felt right, but we took it anyway.
 
The area around Shillong is sometimes called the Scotland of the East.  I’ve never been to Scotland, so I’m not qualified to seriously comment on whatever similarities there might be.  But I can be skeptical, given that another Northeast State, Manipur, has been dubbed The Switzerland of the East even though it has no mountains.  Interestingly, “Scotland of the East” is not the product of a marketing campaign; it dates back to Shillong’s early British and Scottish immigrants.  Presumably they knew what they were talking about, or else they were hoping to lure more of their countrymen there in the tradition of Leif Eriksson.
 
Scotlandesque or not, Shillong was a lovely place, an array of brightly colored roofs neatly tucked into the folds of alpine hills. The bazaars and downtown were affluent and bustling, startlingly free of hassle or visible poverty.  We caught a bus up into the hills and admired a massively overflowing waterfall that was vomiting the previous weeks’ monsoon rains into the pools below it.
 
On our stroll back from the waterfall, we passed a large sperm bank, an amusement park and an airforce base.  In front of the base was a fighter jet dramatically mounted on a stand in take-off position, as if ready to fly in the direction of Pakistan at a moment’s notice.  An army truck bounced past us.  The soldiers in the back, cradling their weapons and dangling their feet off the edge, waved at us and made peace signs with their fingers.
 
We passed a placard for the National Potato Institute and a sign promising a viewpoint at some indeterminate distance to our right.  Knowing in the back of my mind that we probably would never find the view, we decided to follow it.  The road curved endlessly through field and forest, everything a glistening mass of green, and a lone abandoned motorcycle.  45 minutes later, we were climbing uphill through herds of cows with no sign of an epic vista.
 
In front of us, however, was some of the most idealistic farmland I have ever seen.  Cabbages were stacked among rows of crops that gently rolled away on hills into a grey and darkening horizon.  Our road ended at a military base of ambiguous type a hundred feet farther on.
We approached the base, and Morgan made conversation with two of the guards at the gate.  They were receptive to our presence, telling us cheerfully that most of their military equipment was American-made, and helped us flag down a van back to the center of town.
 
The next night, with Morgan back at the hotel feeling sick, I stumbled into a festival of Northeast Indian music at the Shillong State Library.  I had just been wandering by when the poster for the event caught my eye and I realized it had started just an hour earlier.  I saw ensembles from Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and a particularly good choir from Manipur.  The audience consisted mostly of the performers, most of who left after playing their set, so that when the emcee thanked the audience at the end she was addressing me and the bare handful of others still in the auditorium.  Two of these were German teenagers on break from teaching English in Jorhat, a little city in nearby Assam.  They were the first foreigners I’d seen since Morgan and I had left Darjeeling.

Shillong was a nice place to relax, but we had plans to push farther south into Meghalaya, to Cherrapunjee on the Bangladesh border.
 
Cherrapunjee and its environs are said to be the wettest place in the world.  Such superlatives are always worthy of skepticism, but unlike Khardung La’s dubious self-promotion as the world’s highest motorable road, Cherrapunjee’s claim has credence:  The village of Mawsynram, a few kilometers from Cherrapunjee, holds the world record for average annual rainfall, at 11,872 millimeters (I believe a village in Colombia has its hat in the ring as well).  Cherrapunjee itself retains the record for most rainfall ever recorded in a given 12-month period, with 26,461 millimeters measured between August 1860 and August 1861.  That is approximately the total volume of rain that fell on Seattle between 1988 and 2014.
 
When Morgan and I arrived in Cherrapunjee it was completely dry.  We received a warm welcome from our guesthouse’s owner, a dreadlocked man named Heprit whose establishment was the only known budget accommodation in town.  Heprit gave us a map of local attractions, a glossary of useful terms in Khasi, the local language, and a brief diatribe on his dislike of Italians for being rude.
 
Morgan and I set off to see the local sights, which consisted of an impressive variety of curiosities.  Some were low-key, like the network of caves you could pay a small fee to explore or the small stone monoliths that were scattered across the hilltops and front yards of houses.  More interesting to me were the churches and cross-shaped markers that we spotted as we meandered from one village to the next.  Meghalaya is one of three Indian states with a majority Christian population; the others are its Northeast sisters Mizoram and Nagaland.  For the first time, I fancied that I saw the inspiration behind Meghalaya’s “Scotland of the East” appellation:  The grassy hills and wooden churches were at the very least a world removed from the India I had seen in the previous three months.
 
As Morgan and I walked down the road, one of the most surreal experiences of my life occurred:  A car passed us from behind and screeched to a halt by the side of the road.  Three men got out and approached us.  Each of them vigorously shook my hand, posed for a presidential-style photograph with the two of us frozen in a handshake and smiling at the camera, and asked where I was from.  Then they got back in their car and drove off.  It was all over in less than two minutes.
 
As we continued in a southerly direction from Cherrapunjee, we came upon the most startling geological transition I have ever seen.  The cliffs of Meghalaya fell away in front of us to reveal the deltas of Bangladesh.  Little waterfalls cascaded down the ninety-degree cliff faces.  The deltas stretched away into infinity, a shade of blue light enough that standing there felt like looking over the edge of the world and seeing sky below.
 
It must be the most geologically precise national border in the world.  If we had hiked another mile along the cliff I could have leapt out of India into Bangladesh, albeit at the cost of falling into a half-flooded wasteland.

We saved the most famous of Cherrapunjee’s attractions for the following morning.  We awoke to a drizzle, which became a downpour during the 20-minute bus ride into the hills south of Cherrapunjee proper.  The rain was fierce indeed.  The bus let us off in a small village and we immediately refuge in a small teahouse.  The place was packed with locals, who alternately stared at us and out into the rain, sucking paan juice through stained lips.  Many of them were accompanied by young children in uniform, likely ambushed by the rain on their walk to school.  I wonder if that was a daily occurrence for these people.
 
After a few minutes the rain began to let up, and we splashed back out onto the road, and then onto a smaller road that wound downhill and out into a mat of densely forested hills.
We passed more schoolchildren, all walking barefoot, carrying their shoes and clearly unperturbed by the recent downpour.  No matter the time of day, herds of uniformed schoolchildren were a constant feature of the Indian landscape, as ubiquitous as the cows that intermingled with the traffic.
 
We turned off the road onto a dirt trail that marched down the hill in switchbacks.  We passed houses with clotheslines and chickens pecking around the yard.  The rain soon stopped altogether, which was unimpressive behavior from a world-record holder.
 
The switchbacks halted at a flight of stone steps that wound through the foliage and disappeared from sight far below.  There were about 3,000 of them.  We started down.  Every so often we passed someone walking up.  More often than not it was a smiling elderly person.
When we reached the bottom of the stairs, we were very much in the jungle.  We hiked for two hours across bridges spanning noisy rapids, up waterlogged trails and down again, while a backdrop of rainforested mountains peeked at us through the foliage.  I felt like I was in Papua New Guinea or the Congo. 
 
The rain started again, but still we tramped farther.  At long last, the trail led out onto a ledge overlooking another rushing river.  A bridge of tree roots wrapped together like electrical wires spanned the river, wide enough for one person to walk on comfortably.  It was an impressive feat of natural engineering: The bridge was as strong as the trees whose roots formed it from either side.  This was the area’s claim to fame and Meghalaya’s major tourist attraction.
 
We crossed to the other side, where half a dozen simple wooden houses squatted among trees in the rain.  There was no one else in sight.  But any Heart of Darkness-esque feeling of adventure was popped by the house immediately to our right, which was almost shaking to the pulses of Aqua’s Barbie Girl emanating from within.
 
Several times during my trip I heard travelers remark with surprise at the ubiquity of technology in remote and poor areas.  I heard about high-altitude villages in the far reaches of Ladakh with satellite TV and Cambodian houseboat-dwellers with new iPhone 5s.  From my own experience, I can affirm that it’s often difficult to find a landscape that doesn’t have powerlines running across it.
 
After catching a glimpse of a second root bridge, a shorter double-decker one, we turned around and did the whole hike in rewind, back across the bridges and up the thousands of steps.  Near the top, a local man with a bowler hat fell into stride next to us.  He was padding along barefoot and had an empty gasoline container strapped to his back.  He told us his name was Byron, which I thought was strange.  He explained that his parents named him after the poet Lord Byron, he said, because he liked to sing as a young child.  Supposedly Khasi parents typically wait two or three years to name a child, and often do so based on the child’s personality.  I wonder how they address their children before that, and why Byron’s parents didn’t name him Elvis or Frank.
 
We parted ways with Byron in the village and hitched a ride back to Cherrapunjee in the back of a pick-up truck.

We left Cherrapunjee the next day for one more night in Shillong.  This time we checked into a youth hostel the German teenagers had told me about.  Much like Mumbai’s Salvation Army Guesthouse, this was a youth hostel in the full Christian tradition.  A staffperson ushered us into the office of the director, a somber bespectacled man whose appearance would have been completed by a set of black robes and leather-bound Bible.
 
The director offered us a plate of wheat thins.
 
“You are Christians?”  The question was friendly, but was asked as though it were a foregone conclusion.  I nodded solemnly and vigorously.
 
“I-S-I-S is killing Christians,” he told us thoughtfully, for no readily obvious reason.
 
He looked from Morgan to me.  “And you are married, I see?”
 
I hesitated for a minute and then caved in and allowed that we weren’t, earning a reproachful side-eye from Morgan.  We had talked about this.  For the past two weeks we had been half-heartedly posing as a married couple where it was socially convenient to do so, mainly for Morgan’s sake, but I wasn’t very good at staying in character.  Thus it was that I ended up in the male dormitory and Morgan got a private room.  Per the rules, males and females couldn’t mix unless they were lawfully wedded.
 
There was one other western guest at the hostel, a Texan woman with horn-rimmed glasses whose appearance and demeanor screamed “missionary.”  I believe she told us that she was in town for some kind of leadership conference.  She appeared slightly perturbed that Morgan and I were traveling alone, and advised us to be careful, of what I’m not entirely sure.
 
We got the hell out of there the next morning and caught a bus back to Guwahati.
