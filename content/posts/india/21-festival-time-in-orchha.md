I always dreaded wearing my backpack in the streets because it was a 30-pound red flag that I needed a tuuk-tuuk, or a room, or both. Leaving Taj Ganj for the Agra Train Station was no different, as every driver I passed clamored for my attention with shouts and big waves.
 
The driver I eventually chose, namely the one I locked eyes with first, had a grip on my forearm, but I indicated that I wanted him to wait a moment. The sound of drums and blaring music was emanating from a procession moving down the street towards us. The people in the parade were dancing and throwing colored powder into the air. I walked towards the front of the parade and was greeted with a grin and a faceful of powder from the man closest to me. He then scooped a liberal amount of the yellow and orange stuff and rubbed it across my face like Rafiki from the Lion King. Then he and the others danced on, as the music moved slowly down the street.
 
I waltzed into the Agra train station with a spring in my step, still caked in a sweaty frosting of powder. If I momentarily forgot my appearance, the stares of the people in the station--more intense than usual--always brought me back to reality.
 
My train was to Jhansi, a fourth-tier city two hours from Agra. I had heard of a homestay in a town near there called Orchha, and I had decided to stop off en route to Varanasi.
 
There were four other people in my compartment, including a young brother and sister. The sister, who was close to my age, was holding her phone up with her back to me, After a moment, I noticed a pixellated likeness of myself sliding into center on the phone's screen, and I realized that she was covertly photographing me in selfie mode. I pretended not to notice. I would like to think that she was trying to capture my flaming good looks, but the fact that I was very sweaty, tall and looked like I had a terrible fake tan is just as likely.
 
During one of the train's frequent stops to Jhansi, a beggar crawled into our compartment on all fours. He was about fifteen, and was sweeping the floor in front of him with a brush in one hand while he begged with the other outstretched in front of him. I brushed him off, but the girl in my compartment fished a coin out of her purse and handed it to him. I was instantly humbled. I had a general policy of not giving money to panhandlers at all. There were so many of them, first of all, and the omnipresence of their sad gazes and nagging hands encouraged desensitization instead of sympathy. For some off-the-wall reason, as the beggar crawled by my impassive and silent figure, I was reminded of the oft-cited conservative response to hand-outs, that giving to these people discouraged them from finding a livelihood of their own. Applying that argument here was almost humorous, that my lack of generosity was teaching this boy a lesson about being self-sufficient and not relying on others.
 
A Tibetan I met in Dharamsala had used a similar line of reasoning to explain to me why he never gave hand-outs to beggars in India. While this logic made sense at the time, looking back on it I think that at best it just covered up the fact that beggars made him as impatient and uncomfortable as they did the rest of us.

From Jhansi I caught a rickshaw to Orchha, half an hour out into the baking countryside of tall grasses and occasional trees.
 
The monsoon came, sudden and heavy, as I was walking through Orchha's market.
 
I scuttled under the awning of a peddler's stall, next to cheap jewelry and bronze bowls filled with colored powder. I dug at the powder caked onto my face; it was dissolving in the rain, but there was still enough of it to guarantee that I was a spectacle.
 
As the rain diminished, I walked through the market and out of Orchha proper, along a road that wound upwards into the surrounding countryside. My homestay was in a village 15 minutes away.
 
After one more downpour that pinned me against a concrete edifice, I checked in at my homestay in the village. The family included an indeterminate number of adults and four little kids who were as curious about me as any child would be of a strange-looking person, The adults, on the other hand, had a limited knowledge of English and an even more limited interest in bridging the language gap.
 
This atmosphere wasn't particularly inspiring, so I set off back down the road towards Orchha town.
 
Following the road out of Orchha in any direction brought you into an empty countryside of green fields, water buffalo and occasional strings of houses. This was Madhya Pradesh, the Nebraska and Wyoming of India, the country's little visited and sparsely populated interior. Orchha was in fact barely over the Madhya Pradesh border; the state extended far to the south, through tiger parks, jungles and cities forgotten by guidebooks and tourists.
 
Orchha was full of temples and ruins that poked serenely out of the scrub like lost relics. They weren't quite Angkor Wat, but there were no Angkor Wat crowds, either. These ruins were almost forgotten: I explored one for a few minutes without encountering anyone except for one pushy and customer-starved guide.
 
As I was cutting along one of Orchha's main roads back from the temple, a large truck rumbled past me.  Purple and orange-stained people were crammed into the back and onto the top. Amidst the thicket of their arms and torsos was propped a statue of many-armed Ganesh, bedecked with garlands. The people cheered as they passed, and some waved. Another truck went by, and then another, each bearing a Ganesh attended by his honor guard,
 
On an impulse, I changed course and began strolling in the direction they were going. I had nothing else to do. The row of buildings to my left fell away to reveal the rocky shore of the Ganges River, the holy artery of Hinduism. There were people standing along the outcroppings that jutted into the water, and I paused to take in the beautiful view before continuing along the bank.
 
Climbing up an embankment, I was greeted with a view of the climax of the Ganesh festival, the final destination of those Ganesh-bearing trucks. A large stone citadel rose behind stone steps leading down to the river. In the citadel's shadow were a hundred revelers, smeared with water, dirt and colored powder. The statues of Ganesh had been placed along the stone steps, around which the people were cavorting and lighting incense.
 
As I walked into their midst, I was swept up into a sea of  bodies, many half-naked from swimming in the river.
 
I'm not sure that I have ever seen such pure, riotous happiness at a holiday before, the kind of happiness that makes the bearer want to throw his arms around the shoulders of everyone around him.
 
"This is India, this is my country, this is very beautiful Hindu festival, this is Ganesh festival!" someone said with their arm around me. At best, we in America may exhibit that kind of excitement around massive sporting events--but only if your team is a contender.
 
Several of the people assembled around me were exhibiting symptoms of acute drunkenness. One young guy was slurring heavily, and he wasn't alone. After gripping my hand in warm greeting, he motioned that I should take off my shirt and go for a dip. I quickly realized that he was fully intent on dragging me into the water with him. He seemed to take my refusal as an affront to the festival and to Ganesh, and his tugs became ever more insistent and irritated the longer I held my ground. For a moment I thought I'd have to grapple with him to avoid tumbling into the already crowded river. I was saved when another man appeared at his shoulder and steered his friend away. "Sorry, boss," he told me with a disapproving look.
 
The handshakes and photo-ops weren't new to me, but the setting was. As I watched, a cheer went up and a group of men stooped and hoisted their Ganesh onto their shoulders. They clambered to the waterline and waded in, clearing a path through the people already splashing around in the river. Everyone turned to watch as the men swam out towards the middle, until only their heads were bobbing above the surface.
 
This act of returning Ganesh to the water is the climax of the god's celebration. I assume that their must be metric tons of elephant god detritus lying at the bottom of the Ganges and on the Arabian Seabed. It certainly explained the crumbling Ganesh idol that I had seen washed up on the beach in Mumbai.
 
To my left, another group was preparing to return their god to the water. Their statue was the largest, the size of an overweight child. The best they could do was to tip it in headfirst, to whoops from everyone assembled onshore.
 
I separated myself from the crowd and walked up the steps, past men elaborately decorating their statues like bodies being prepared for their final rites. I jumped out of the way of some firecrackers and left the scene behind me, following an orange-robed holy man back along the river and into town.

I was most preoccupied now with booking my train ticket for Varanasi.  I wanted to go the next day, and I was already confronting the possibility that seats would be completely filled. Because the nearest station was in Jhansi, I set off in search of travel agents in Orchha's downtown.
 
The first one I found, a twitchy man who inhabited a closet-sized office, told me that he could procure a ticket for me if I waited an hour, which made no sense because he was perfectly capable of printing it out right there in his office, and he clearly had nothing else to do.
 
I ditched him and walked across the street to another matchbox travel agency, only to find the door locked. A balding man reclining in a chair outside told me that the agent was out. When I asked when he would return, the man shrugged and told me fifteen minutes, with an air that made it clear it would be much longer than fifteen minutes. Jokes about Indian Standard Time are common among travelers in India, and the punchline of all of them is that any length of time quoted by Indian sources should be multiplied by a factor of three or four.
 
I knew this well already, so I continued my walk along the darkening street, keeping an eye out for signs advertising ticket booking.
 
The man I eventually found owned a small general store with a computer in the front corner. He was congenial and polite, and had two young children who were poking their noses over the front counter. We sat down at the computer, he put on his glasses and fumblingly opened the India Rail website, and I quickly realized that I was in very poor hands. Every time a new screen popped up, he stared at it as though he had never seen it before. He searched for each letter on the keyboard as though he were rummaging for change in a glove compartment, so that each keystroke came slowly and deliberately. Even after he had agonizingly entered my information into each box of the booking form, he invariably clicked on something wrong, the page expired and took us back to square zero. On the fourth or fifth try, we broke through to the payment page, whereupon he entered his payment information incorrectly. On the next try, it became clear he had no idea how to complete an online transaction.
 
"My brother will come. He is doctor," he told me serenely.
 
I wasn't convinced that this made his brother any more likely to be able to navigate a web form.
 
The doctor emerged from the back room and took his brother's chair. They both frowned thoughtfully as he mis-entered my information one, two, and then three times. On the fourth, right as I was threatening to walk out, he miraculously navigated the webform and paid for the ticket without any misfires. It was a small victory over a small crisis, but after a draining day I was happy to take it.

I found my homestay mildly uncomfortable. Much of my short stay involved confirming that yes, I would like to eat the next meal, and yes, 6 pm ought to be fine. For each meal, I sat on the stone floor of one of the unlit back buildings and ate my way through the thali that the mother had prepared for me. I never ate with the family, although the mother squatted and watched me, and sometimes one of the kids would loiter around and scratch a pattern on the floor with a broken Happy Meal toy, until an older relative scooped him up and took him outside.
 
My room was both separated from the family's other buildings physically--in a back courtyard--and in terms of comfort and aesthetic. For one thing, my room was alone in having electricity. This only really occurred to me when two of the kids sauntered in the open door and spent ten minutes standing on my bed and pushing each other out of the way for a chance to flick the light switch on and off.
 
I'm skeptical that the dynamics of a homestay like this can ever truly produce the cultural exchange that always seems to be the intention behind them. When one side is much wealthier, more mobile and better educated than the other, the exchange can hardly be equal on both sides. Paying for the privilege of interacting with a local family has always made me feel like I'm a guest at some kind of show put on on my behalf. This family's means were humbler and their world was smaller than I could imagine, but I was staying in what was, by my standards, a four-star hotel room.

The day of my evening train to Varanasi, I was walking through the baking heat of Orchha back towards my homestay. As I paused for a minute to let some of the sweat drip off me, a woman leaned out of a window to my right and waved to me. I already suspected where this was leading, but I approached her and accepted her invitation to step into her house. The interior was a cool relief from the blazing heat outside. We talked sitting on the bed in her front room, and she brought me a cup of chai. Her teenage daughter emerged from a courtyard in front of us and sat down cross-legged on the floor.
 
The woman was merry and rosy-faced. Her daughter was shy, but we went through some forced chatter for a few minutes while her mother was away in another room. I contemplated leaving at this point, but as I had accepted the tea I felt that I ought to have the good grace to sit through whatever awaited me.
 
The mother returned and motioned me across the courtyard into a darker bedroom, where she pulled out a box of textiles and a smaller box of bangles. I had known this was the goal from the beginning, but it was still disappointing, as always, to discover that the polite conversation had all been a pretext for this moment. I thumbed through the fabrics for a minute, but I shook my head. The woman frowned, but stayed relatively graceful. We walked back into the front room, where her daughter was now standing in front of a little mirror and brushing her hair.
 
"And what about sister gift?" the woman asked, rounding on me.
 
"What?"
 
The girl turned towards me. She was freshening herself up, and had adopted a noticeably more confident poise than when she had first appeared. "You could...take me to the market and buy me something. A gift."
 
The woman stood with her arms folded and looked approvingly at her daughter, then to me.
 
"What kind of gift?" I was a little non-plussed.
 
"Oh, I like...jewelry. Pretty things."
 
I walked towards the door, The woman stomped after me. "No money?" she screeched. Her face had squashed into an expression of anger, as though I had slighted her. I pressed ten rupees into her outstretched palm, said "For the tea," and left, The door's slam echoed in my ears as I trudged back up the road.
 
This kind of thing happens to everyone who spends enough time in India. Mariano told me of being invited to dinner by an Indian man in Delhi and having a two-hour conversation, whereupon the man turned to him and said conspiratorially, "Hey, wanna buy some pashminas?"
 
At this point, I had accepted that I could have two types of interactions in India. One kind were those interactions whose purpose was to extract money from me; the other kind was genuine and heartfelt, as my experience down at the Ganges had been. But their combined onslaught wore me down to a nubbin at the end of each day, and it was the same on this one, when I settled into my hard bunk on the train to Varanasi, glad for my little sliver of quiet space.
