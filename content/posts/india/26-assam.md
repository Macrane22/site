From Guwahati we planned to go to Kaziranga to meet Morgan’s friend Rafiq.  Unable to find transportation all the way there, we spent a night in a small city called Tezpur along the way.  The morning after that, a cramped public minibus dropped us in the town of Kaziranga, just outside the famous park of the same name.  Like almost every national park in India, Kaziranga was currently closed for the wet season, but we were hopeful that with Rafiq’s help we could at least catch a glimpse of the famed rhinos within.
 
Rafiq had connected us with one of his friends who owned a guesthouse and had arranged a room for us at a discount.  We sat waiting for the friend in a small restaurant, eating puri and taking in the early-morning stupor.  He arrived about twenty minutes later, a very muscular guy with a nice car, and drove us just up the road to his establishment.  We were his first guests:  Workmen were moving furniture when we arrived, and the walls gleamed with new white paint.
 
We met up with Rafiq shortly after that, and he drove us out towards the park.  It turned out that even Rafiq’s status as guide and respected birdwatcher was insufficient to bend park rules.  After a short argument with a uniformed guard, we gave up on our hopes of entering Kaziranga itself.
 
Kaziranga was low-lying, marshy and wild.  We explored the park’s perimeter, walking past small wooden houses and lurching elephants with bushels of leaves (and sometimes passengers) on their backs.  The source of Rafiq’s birdwatching passion was obvious, for there were birds aplenty:  Morgan and I watched while he paddled out into the middle of a lake on a bamboo raft, his camera balanced gingerly beside him, in pursuit of a large and graceful heron-like specimen. 
 
The star of Kaziranga is the great one-horned rhinoceros.  About 2,400 of them are estimated to live inside the park, about three-fifths of the world’s total.  The population is increasing, although each year several—35 in 2014—fall prey to poachers, who Rafiq claimed are often poor young men from nearby Bangladesh.
 
Rafiq led us up to the border fence and produced an impressive set of binoculars.  Even with pressing my eyes against the lenses, I had a hard time spotting the rhinos among the tall grasses until he pointed them out.  They looked like rounded light-grey boulders, each speckled by a posse of small white birds.  Occasionally, one of them would lumber forward a few steps, taking its avian stowaways with it.  It was a little underwhelming, partly because I had heard stories of tourists on elephants going out into the park and having tense stand-offs with the rhinoceroses.
 
After nightfall, Kaziranga went almost completely dark, with not a single streetlight in sight and many windows unlit.  The freshly whitened ceiling of our guesthouse room was blackened with insects, who were slowly but steadily dropping dead from the mosquito coils burning on the bedside table.
 
I stumbled out in search of an internet café, following the marshy shoulder of the road towards the main part of town.  Not sure where to look, I walked into a small open-air restaurant and asked the owners for the nearest internet.  They nodded and beckoned me into a back room, where one of them rummaged in a cabinet and emerged holding two bottles of whiskey, looking at me expectantly.
 
Comprehension of spoken English had dropped noticeably in Assam.  Rafiq’s English was excellent, but for many here even Hindi was a second language behind their native Assamese, and English a distant third.  Incidentally, Assamese is one of 22 languages that the Indian Constitution deems to be official, although I think the meaning of “official” here is cultural as much as practical:  English isn’t among the 22, although it is very much an official government language, but Sanskrit is.
 
I eventually found a computer with internet in a small copy shop.  As I was sitting there, a loud bang, maybe a car backfiring, came from outside.  I stepped out of the shop and looked around.  A jeepful of Indian soldiers was loitering on the corner.  Their commander barked an order and they stepped back into their vehicle, which drove off into the night.  When I asked the unfazed copy shop manager what was going on, he said that an important Assamese official was arriving the next day.
 
I think for many residents of Northeast India, the military’s regular presence was just an unobtrusive fact of everyday life.  I later found out about the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Acts, a somewhat astonishing series of laws that gives the Indian military certain protections in the applicable regions, including immunity from prosecution unless the Indian government gives its express permission.  These laws primarily target conflict-ridden Kashmir and Manipur, but apply in the other six Northeast states as well, all but one of whom—Arunachal Pradesh—have histories of insurgency.

We awoke early the next morning, and Rafiq’s friend drove us back to where he had picked us up the day before.  We stood by the side of the road for twenty minutes as buses crammed to the seams with people passed by.  When at last a half-empty one came along, we clambered aboard, bound for Majuli Island, the next stop in our northeastward creep through Assam.
 
The bus took us as far as Jorhat, a mid-sized city, where we disembarked and caught a van for the docks of the Brahmaputra River.
 
Majuli Island is India’s largest river island and often claims to be the world’s largest, although that isn’t even close to accurate (and never will be:  Lonely Planet claims the island is swiftly eroding and won’t exist in in a couple decades).  However, we were interested not in its size but in its unusual culture:  Majuli is home to a number of monasteries called satras, which belong to a major branch of Hinduism called Vaishnavism and which, most interesting of all to us, offer cheap lodging for visitors.
 
We caught a ferry at the dock and stood on deck watching the trees of Majuli slowly come into focus.  Apart from my reluctantly agreement to be in a picture with a paunchy mustached passenger, the voyage was uneventful.  The man was playing Justin Bieber’s Baby on his phone, bobbing his head in slight acknowledgement of the tinny beat.  It was the first non-Indian song I had heard in public since Barbie Girl.
 
After stepping off the ferry on the other shore, we caught a rickshaw to one of the larger satras.  We were greeted by a Hindu monk dressed in white robes with his hair tied in a bun at the back of his head.  He showed us to our bunks in the dormitory, which lay separate from the monks’ quarters.  There was another foreigner staying in the building, a French photographer who was hanging colorful tapestries on the porch in preparation for a photo shoot.
 
Morgan stayed behind to watch while I set off to explore Majuli on foot.  It was a beautiful day, warm and breezy.  I followed a winding footpath over toy wooden bridges and through fields.  Majuli Island seemed to consist of nothing but bright blues and greens, which were doubly bold in the sunlight.
 
Presently I heard the sound of chanting up ahead, coming from an open-air shelter.  The structure had only one wall, with pillars at the other corners to support the roof.  A circle of women in brightly-colored saris sat around the perimeter, singing and clapping rhythmically.  I poked my head in out of curiosity.
 
Without interrupting their chanting, a couple of the women smiled at me and motioned enthusiastically to join them.  I took a seat cross-legged in a gap on the right side of the circle, and found myself locked into a Hindu ceremony that lasted much longer than I would have guessed.
 
The chanting went on and on.  Three or four older women at the circle’s head were clearly leading the proceedings.  They had large books propped open in front of them and were scanning the lines, while the rest of the circle followed a fraction of a beat behind.  I clapped along with the women, unable to do anything else.
 
Every five or ten minutes, the chanting would stop as the prayer ended.  There would a few moments’ restless silence while I wondered whether the proceedings were over.  Then the leaders flipped the page of their books and began anew.  Within two or three seconds the rest of the group was droning along.  I don’t think I imagined the eyerolls of some of the younger women across from me, or the noticeable decrease in enthusiasm with each new prayer.
 
A little boy and a man walked into the enclosure and joined the gap next to me.  The man had a drum that he beat in time with the claps.  A woman walked over and handed the boy a small pair of cymbals and me an even smaller one.  They weren’t much bigger than finger cymbals, but I beat them with renewed enthusiasm.  My palms were getting sore.
 
Three or four times I got up and tried to graciously leave.  Each time, several of the women gesticulated vigorously but encouragingly, telling me to sit back down.  I clashed my cymbals determinedly through another set of prayers.  At last the ceremony seemed to be ending:  The women leaned back on their cushions, several visibly relieved.  Some of them chatted with their neighbors, others sat in silence.
 
I got up to leave again, gesturing my appreciation for their hospitality, but was told to sit down again.  An old man and a couple of attendants walked in with cooking pots and banana leaves.  We all scooted from our circular arrangement into rows, each person sitting on a mat with a banana leaf in front of her.
 
The attendants walked down the rows, spooning food onto the leaves.  The meal was one of the stranger ones I’ve ever had.  It consisted of two large balls of flour, sugar and water that were mostly uncooked, two very sweet bananas and a pile of bean sprouts with chunks of coconut and ginger.  I exchanged a few words with my neighbors, but they spoke very little to no English.  My Hindi, which I had been honing with Morgan, was laughably inadequate.
 
After finishing the meal, I thanked everyone for their kindness and left the enclosure.  I didn’t feel like heading back to the monastery just yet, so I set off further into the island’s interior.  The fields and ponds extended for as far as I could see, which wasn’t too far as evening approached.  I met a couple of teenagers and hopped on to the back of one of their bicycles.  They dropped me off at the edge of a small village, and I stood for a moment trying to get my bearings while admiring the landscape’s quiet tranquility.
 
It was almost completely dark at this point, so I began to navigate back towards the monastery.  I checked my phone for the first time in hours.  There were two missed calls from Morgan and an urgent text explaining that she had discovered her visa had expired that day.  She was already on her way to the airport in Guwahati to catch a flight to Bangkok.
 
Stomach lurching, I rushed back to the dormitory.  Sure enough, Morgan and her backpack were gone.  With her went any remaining aspiration to go to Arunachal Pradesh, and any inkling I had about where to go next.
 
One of the monks came by the room with the French photographer, both looking concerned.  The photographer translated the monk’s Hindi with good English, telling me that Morgan had left in a hurry and had mentioned a family emergency.  I told them that Morgan was fine.  She later told me that she had used that story because the rickshaw driver who had arrived to pick her up had been a tad forward in his advances—the imaginary family member in question had been Morgan’s husband.
 
I walked across the courtyard that night into the monks’ section of the satra.  Their quarters lay in a row like a motel, across from a larger building.  I walked inside and found the monks in the middle of some kind of recital.  Most of them sat in a circle around the edges of the room, while a few performed in the middle.  One of them told me after the fact that this was a Hindu legend about Vishnu, and that they were rehearsing for a performance in Guwahati and subsequently for one in Delhi.  There was a lot of spinning and dancing, a lot of it quite graceful, and some spoken lines.  An older man with glasses, sitting across from me, stopped the performers every once in a while to sternly go over a line.  He had short hair, as did all of the boys, some of them as young as six or seven.  All of the others had the same buns, and all were dressed in identical white robes.
 
In contrast to the ceremony earlier in the day, the monks made it clear that I was to remain outside of their circle, near the wall by the door.  I stayed there for a while, alternately preoccupied by the performance and by a palm-sized spider skirting around the floor near my left knee.  Monastic life didn’t seem totally austere after all—there was a lot of laughter, particularly among the younger monks, and a clear sense of camaraderie.  It wasn’t enough for me to don a pair of white robes myself, and not nearly enough for me to grow a bun, but it was something.
