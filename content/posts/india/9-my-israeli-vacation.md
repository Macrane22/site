A lot of travel authenticity snobs turn their noses up at Manali, and I could see why after an hour of walking along the winding uphill roads and damp little paths. There wasn’t much India in sight—after seeing Islam in Kashmir and Buddhism in Ladakh, it was pretty clear that the main religion here was Tourism, a few half-hearted prayer flags notwithstanding. Most visible vestiges of Indian culture had a whiff of kitsch about them. For instance, there were the men dressed in traditional Hindu garb who beckoned you over and pulled the lid off a little basket to reveal a live cobra rearing inside. The cobras weren’t as big or impressive as the ones I’d seen in movies, but they were real nonetheless. They quickly lost their appeal once it became clear the men were charging for a photograph with the snake.
 
Manali, capital of the state of Himachal Pradesh, is an example of what Indians call a hill station—a cool and verdant place to escape the heat and bustle of the subcontinent. To westerners, it’s a mountain resort town with good access to surrounding outdoor activities and a thriving local drug scene. The main street through Old Manali was lined by touts—passive and polite by Indian standards—offering everything from minerals and toy drums to heroin.
 
My first dinner in Manali was in a smoke-filled neon hole with rave music blaring off the walls, which were covered with the signs of the zodiac and a decorative Star of David. The owner was dancing alluringly in the entryway when I passed, and I was worn out enough to not want to explore further, so I followed him into the back. There were several Israelis sitting on cushions around low tables, including one guy who could have played Draco Malfoy if Tom Felton opted out.
 
And that was a perfect introduction to Manali. I spent six days there, during which, for the most part, not a lot happened.
 
On my third day there, I met a young Israeli named Dor while eating breakfast. Like all the travelling Israelis, he was one or two years out of his military service. Not uncommonly, he hadn’t been a fighter, but a battlefield surgery instructor.
 
Dor and I took an auto up to Vashisht, a village ten minutes away that has a reputation for being more Manali-esque than Old Manali, which means it’s quieter, the marijuana grows taller and the Israelis are more plentiful.
 
It was a really pleasant spot—there were views of the surrounding valley and mountains over the village rooftops, and it was indeed quiet. Vashisht is known for its waterfalls, so we started walking along the winding forest trail. Along the way we met a ponytailed Israeli friend of Dor’s named Pinni, who was easily pushing thirty. Pinni showed us to the waterfall, which cascaded in a thick trickle from the vertical cliffs above into a pool at our feet. It was a nice view and reminded me a bit of landscape paintings of southern China.
 
Pinni was very aggressive about ensuring that I grasped the full majesty of the scene.
“Sit on that rock,” he commanded, pointing at the boulder in the middle of the pool. “There’s almost always people on it, but you get it all to yourself. Look at the view!” Apparently I was a very lucky guy.
 
It turned out that Pinni had been coming to Vashisht for three-month stretches every year for quite a while. I was impressed by his passion for the area, but a little startled at his dismissal of the rest of the subcontinent. He had barely been out of Vashisht in two months, he told me, because he loved the place that much.
 
Walking back from the waterfall, we stopped for lunch at the house of a local family that Dor knew, where Pinni railed against the military service requirement in Israel. He had spent his three years filing papers in some kind of secretarial role. I’m sure it was as suffocating as he made it sound, but I could already tell that his complaints needed to be taken with a grain of salt. He had a penchant for whining I wouldn’t have expected in someone his age. “Look at my skin,” he told me. “It’s so white, I burn and I have to wear this big hat, like a pussy!” He threw up his arms in despair.

Back in Old Manali, Dor took me to one of the local sites I was most interested in. Just across from my hostel was a narrow lane guarded by a Hebrew sign that led to a three-story building. On the second floor was a colorful TV room with The Dark Knight Rises playing on the screen. A dozen young Israelis were sitting around the room, including one of the girls I biked down Khardung La with, some of them eating dishes of Israeli food. There were coloring books and Sudoku puzzles scattered around.
 
Dor and Pinni had first told me about this place back in Vashisht. Part travel agency, part guesthouse and restaurant, this was a center that catered exclusively to the Israeli travelers in the area. More interestingly, though, Pinni claimed that it also served as a safehouse for young Israelis who fell too far into the local drug scene and needed to be flown home.
 
“These young people, they get out of the army and there, that’s their life, the past three years, so how do they start over? How do they start a life after that ordeal? A lot of them start doing a lot of drugs. It’s very sad.”
 
I can’t personally vouch for all of these troubled cases that Pinni mentioned, but it’s common knowledge in Manali that the party capital of Himachal is in the nearby village of Kasol, an Israeli haven and center of the local rave scene. There were flyers circulating for a big upcoming party there, featuring a combination of Israeli and Indian DJs. Colloquially the place is called Kasol-Aviv.
 
I had dinner with Dor, who told me that many Israelis choose to travel either to India or South America after finishing their military service. Over at the next table, Draco Malfoy was puffing on a massive pipe.
 
One of Dor’s big goals in northern India was to take flute lessons. I met another friendly Israeli guy, a former Tae Kwon Do athlete, who was taking courses on cosmic consciousness. I didn’t have time to ask him what that meant. I can’t link all of these holistic interests to disillusionment with the military without a fair amount of speculation: With the Israel-Palestine conflict in the news every day, the topic was on everyone’s mind but was not a regular topic of conversation. The few opinions I heard ranged from dismissive to sheepish and openly regretful.
But I suspect that the more pacifistic and spiritual Israelis, like everyone else, were drawn to Northern India over anywhere else. And, to be sure, the lush mountains of Himachal provide a backdrop for this spiritual search that Israel could never offer.

Not wanting to sit in Manali, I repeated my exercise from Leh and began frequenting the local travel agency inquiring about excursions. During one of these visits I met a German named Kalle, who had spent the past several weeks surfing off the coast of Sri Lanka.
 
We both put our names down tentatively for a trek, and when that fell through, spent the next several days sitting together in a variety of rooftop cafés with a rotating cast of fellow travelers. These included Tommy, an Irishman who worked with autistic children, and who had formerly worked at a company that manufactured razors, but fell afoul of his boss when he didn’t shave for staff meetings. They also included by first fellow traveler from the USA.
 
 
I thought I had made my first contact upon first arriving in Manali, when a girl with a breathy Annie Hall voice approached me. I took her for an American, but no, she turned out to be a Nova Scotian who had come to HIMACHAL to pick fruit. The first “eh” shattered my fantasy. As it turned out, my first American contact was Kalle’s roommate, a Pennsylvanian named Nico interested in exotic animal rescue.
 
I’m sure that those first four weeks in India is the longest I’ve ever gone without a face-to-face interaction with another American. So it was startling to meet someone who talked so similarly to how I do, a little like looking in a funhouse mirror. Apart from his accent, there were two things that immediately gave Nico away as a native USAer: The first was his aptitude for mispronouncing one-syllable Indian words like naan and Leh. The other was his extreme awareness of all manner of health hazards—not only no meat, but no tea (might not boil for long enough) and no dairy (sitting out in the hot like that). With all due respect to my fellow countrymen, it doesn’t get much more American than that.
 
Wanting to be sporty for at least one day, Kalle and I joined two other Europeans on a canyoning excursion. We drove out to the waterfalls at Vashisht, where we spent a half-day rappelling down them with ropes and crampons. It was quite fun, although on the third waterfall the straps chaffed me straight through my wetsuit, resulting in about fifteen seconds of agony.
 
On the way back, we made a detour to the well-known Vashisht hot springs. As men, our pool was out in the open, but in line with Indian sensibilities, the women’s was hidden inside a concrete bunker. I ran into my Lithuanian and German companions from Leh, all of whom had burned foreheads and peeling noses. I submerged myself in the springs for about a quarter of a second. All the while, the loin-clothed old man opposite me was lazing in them as though it were a swimming pool.
 
Beyond that, though, we ate well and sampled desserts with cryptic names and no corresponding description in the menu (‘Hello to the Queen’? ‘Sweet Jesus’?). There was live music some nights, featuring the same guitar-bass duo who played a combination of local favorites (I assume they were favorites) and excellent classic rock covers.
 
After several days this all began to feel a little hedonistic, and my friends were starting to move on. I was ready to exit the mountains, so quite abruptly I left Manali, setting my sights back into the heat to Amritsar and the Golden Temple.
